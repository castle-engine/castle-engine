#VRML V1.0 ascii

# This is used to show shadows problems when a lot of shadow quads
# are on a single pixel in stencil. This is related to StencilShadowBits
# constant in sources.
#
# _WRAP_EXT helps here greatly. (although there's still some narrow
# line when no shadow is displayed, but it should be there...)
