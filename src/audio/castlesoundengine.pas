    You can explicitly initialize OpenAL context by ALContextOpen,
    and explicitly close it by ALContextClose. If you did not call ALContextOpen
    explicitly (that is, ALInitialized is @false), then the first LoadBuffer
    or TRepoSoundEngine.Sound or TRepoSoundEngine.Sound3D
    will automatically do it for you. If you do not call ALContextClose
    explicitly, then at destructor we'll do it automatically. }

    { How the sound is attenuated with the distance.
      These are used only for spatialized sounds created with PlaySound.
      The DefaultReferenceDistance and DefaultMaxDistance values
      are used only if you don't supply explicit values to PlaySound.

      The exact interpretation of these depends on current
      DistanceModel. See OpenAL specification for exact equations.
      In short:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(Smaller Rolloff Factor makes the attenuation weaker.
          In particular 0 turns off attenuation by distance.
          Default is 1.)
        @item(Reference Distance is the distance at which exactly sound
          gain is heard. Default is 1.)
        @item(Max Distance interpretation depends on the model.
          For "inverse clamped model", the gain is no longer scaled down
          after reaching this distance. For linear models, the gain
          reaches zero at this distance. Default is maximum float
          (I don't know the interpretation of this for linear model).)
      )

      Our default values follow OpenAL default values.

    { How the sources are spatialized. For precise meaning, see OpenAL
      specification of alDistanceModel.

      Note that some models are actually available only since OpenAL 1.1
      version. Older OpenAL versions may (but don't have to) support them
      through extensions. We will internally do everything possible to
      request given model, but eventually may fallback on some other model.
      This probably will not be a problem in practice, as all modern OS
      versions (Linux distros, Windows OpenAL installers etc.) include OpenAL
      1.1.

      The default distance model, DefaultDistanceModel, is the linear model
      most conforming to VRML/X3D sound requirements. You can change it

    From the point of view of end-user the number of sounds
    is constant for given game and their properties (expressed in
    TSoundInfo below) are also constant.
    However, for the sake of debugging/testing the game,
    and for content designers, the actual values of Sounds are loaded
    at initialization by ReadSounds (called automatically by ALContextOpen)
    from sounds XML file,
    and later can be changed by calling ReadSounds once again during the

      Empty means that the sound data is not defined,
      so the OpenAL buffer will not be initialized and trying to play
      this sound (with methods like TSoundEngine.Sound or TSoundEngine.Sound3D)
      will do nothing. This is useful if you want to use a sound name
      in code, but you do not have the actual sound file for this yet. }
    URL: string;

    { Gain (how loud the sound is).
      They are mapped directly to respective OpenAL source properties,
      so see OpenAL specification for exact details what they mean.
      In short:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(Gain scales the sound loudness. Use this to indicate that
          e.g. a plane engine is louder than a mouse squeak (when heard
          from the same distance).

          Do @italic(not) make the actual sound data (in wav, ogg and such files)
          louder/more silent for this purpose.
          This is usually bad for sound quality. Instead, keep your sound data
          at max loudness (normalized), and use this @link(Gain) property
          to scale sound.

          It can be antything from 0 to +infinity. The default is 1.)

        @item(MinGain and MaxGain force a minimum/maximum sound loudness.
          These can be used to "cheat" around default distance attenuation
          calculation.

          These must be in [0, 1] range. By default MinGain is 0 and MaxGain is 1.)
      )

      Note that Gain value > 1 is allowed.
      Although OpenAL may clip the resulting sound (after all
      calculations taking into account 3D position will be done).
      The resulting sound is also clamped by MaxGain
      (that generally must be in [0, 1], although some OpenAL implementations
      allow values > 1).

      When this sound is used for MusicPlayer.Sound:
      @orderedList(
        @item(MinGain, MaxGain are ignored.)
        @item(Effective Gain (passed to OpenAL sound source) is the

    This allows to have simple @link(Sound) and @link(Sound3D) methods,

    automatically under the hood).

    It extends TSoundEngine, so you can always still load new buffers
    and play them by TSoundEngine.LoadBuffer, TSoundEngine.PlaySound
    and all other methods. This only adds easy preloaded sounds,

      engine examples for details (@code(examples/audio/sample_sounds.xml)
      contains an example file with lots of comments).

      When you set RepositoryURL property, we read sound information from
      given XML file. You usually set RepositoryURL at the very beginning,
      before OpenAL context is initialized (although it's also Ok to do this after).
      Right after setting RepositoryURL you usually call SoundFromName
      a couple of times to convert some names into TSoundType values,
      to later use these TSoundType values with @link(Sound) and @link(Sound3D)
      methods.

      When OpenAL is initialized, sound buffers will actually be loaded.

      If this is empty (the default), then no sounds are loaded,
      and TRepoSoundEngine doesn't really give you much above standard
      TSoundEngine.

      If you want to actually use TRepoSoundEngine features
      (like the @link(Sound) and @link(Sound3D) methods) you have to set this
      property. For example like this:

@longCode(#
  SoundEngine.RepositoryURL := ApplicationData('sounds.xml');
  stMySound1 := SoundEngine.SoundFromName('my_sound_1');
  stMySound2 := SoundEngine.SoundFromName('my_sound_2');
  // ... and later in your game you can do stuff like this:
  SoundEngine.Sound(stMySound1);
  SoundEngine.Sound3D(stMySound1, Vector3Single(0, 0, 10));
#)

      See CastleFilesUtils unit for docs of ApplicationData function.

        early enough), or that you specified invalid sound name.
        When Required = @false, missing sound is silently ignored,
        which is sensible if it was optional.

         with alGetString(AL_VENDOR) is more elegant (i.e. affecting more precisely

          (although I think that at some time I experienced similar
          problems (that would be cured by this workaround) on Linux
          (Loki OpenAL implementation)).

          The problem: music on some
          levels doesn't play. This happens seemingly random: sometimes
          when you load a level music starts playing, sometimes it's
          silent. Then when you go to another level, then go back to the
          same level, music plays.

          Investigation: I found that sometimes changing the buffer
          of the sound doesn't work immediately. Simple
            Writeln(SoundInfos.L[Sound].Buffer, ' ',
              alGetSource1ui(FAllocatedSource.ALSource, AL_BUFFER));
          right after alCommonSourceSetup shows this (may output
          two different values). Then if you wait a little, OpenAL
          reports correct buffer. This probably means that OpenAL
          internally finishes some tasks related to loading buffer
          into source. Whatever it is, it seems that it doesn't
          occur (or rather, is not noticeable) on normal game sounds
          that are short --- but it's noticeable delay with larger
          sounds, like typical music.

          So the natural workaround below follows. For OpenAL implementations
          that immediately load the buffer, this will not cause any delay. }
