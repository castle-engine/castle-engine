Introduction
============

The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
(deflation) but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same
stream interface.

Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
application must provide more input and/or consume the output
(providing more output space) before each call.

The default memory requirements for deflate are 256K plus a few kilobytes
for small objects. The default memory requirements for inflate are 32K
plus a few kilobytes for small objects.

Change Log
==========

March 24th 2000 - minizip code by Gilles Vollant ported to Pascal. 
                  z_stream.msg defined as string[255] to avoid problems
                  with Delphi 2+ dynamic string handling.
                  changes to silence Delphi 5 compiler warning. If you
                  have Delphi 5, defines Delphi5 in zconf.inc
                              
May 7th 1999    - Some changes for FPC
                  deflateCopy() has new parameters
                  trees.pas - record constant definition
June 17th 1998  - Applied official 1.1.2 patch. 
	          Memcheck turned off by default.
                  zutil.pas patch for Delphi 1 memory allocation corrected.
                  dzlib.txt file added.
                  compress2() is now exported

June 25th 1998 -  fixed a conversion bug: in inftrees.pas, ZFREE(z, v) was
                  missing in line 574;
