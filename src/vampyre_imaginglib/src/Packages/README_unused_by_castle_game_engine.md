The Vampyre LPK packages in this directory are no longer used by _Castle Game Engine_.

To keep things simple for people who [install CGE from sources](https://castle-engine.io/compiling_from_source.php) the CGE package `castle_base.lpk` now uses Vampyre units directly.

If you have installed Vampyre LPK only for the purpose of using it with CGE, you can now uninstall it.
