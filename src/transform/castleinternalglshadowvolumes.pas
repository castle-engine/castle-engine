    actually render the 3D models or their shadow volumes (actual rendering
    is provided by T3D descendants, like TCastleScene.RenderShadowVolume).

    { Call this when camera frustum is known and light position (of the shadow
      casting light) is known, typically at the beginning of your drawing routine.

      You have to call this before any InitCaster / GetCasterShadowPossiblyVisible
      call. All subsequent InitCaster / GetCasterShadowPossiblyVisible calls
      assume that Frustum and LightPosition remain like this.

      This calculates various things related to shadow volumes rendering
      of this scene.  1. checks whether you need to render shadow of the
      object inside CasterBox, setting CasterShadowPossiblyVisible.
      2. checks whether ZFail method is needed, setting ZFail.

      This assumes that Frustum and LightPosition values given
      in InitFrustumAndLight are OK.

      Also note that after InitFrustumAndLight, all InitCaster will assume that
      they have complete control over glStencilOp states for the time
      of rendering shadow volumes. In other words: InitCaster will setup
      some stencil configuration, depending on ZFail state.
      For the sake of speed, we try to avoid setting the same state
      twice, so we optimize it: first InitCaster after InitFrustumAndLight
      does always setup stencil confguration. Following InitCaster will
      only change stencil configuration if ZFail value will actually change.
      This means that if e.g. all objects will be detected to be in z-pass
      method, then stencil configuration will be done only once.

      The above optimization works OK if you do not change StencilOp configuration
      yourself during SV rendering. }

        { Idea: calculate a pyramid between light position and near plane rectangle
          of the frustum. Assuming light point is positional and it does not
          lie on the near plane, this is simple: such pyramid has 4 side planes
          (created by two succeding near plane rectangle points and light pos),
          and 1 additional plane for near plane.

          Now, if for any such plane, CasterBox is outside, then ZFail is for sure
          not needed.

          Actually, even when the light lies exactly on near rectangle plane,
          usually this is still OK. The trouble will occur only if the light lies
          exactly on one of near rectangle points, since then an invalid
          plane (with 1st three items = 0) will be calculated. In such case,
          at most two planes out of 5 will be invalid (we assume that all 4 near
          rectangle points are for sure different, so the light pos may collide
          with only 1 of them, so only two plane calculations will lead to
          invalid plane). In such case, it's OK to simply ignore invalid planes.

          That's why InsidePlane simply checks for and ignores invalid planes.

          necessarily what we want. We want NearPlane to point CCW outside
          from light+near plane pyramid. In other words, LightPosition should be
          on CW side of this plane. If LightPosition is on CCW side,
          flip NearPlane. Also, calculations of other side planes should
          generate flipped planes. }

          of one of the segments. This will make at most 2 such planes invalid

  { Which stencil bits should be tested when determining which things
    are in the scene ?

    Not only *while rendering* shadow quads but also *after this rendering*
    value in stencil buffer may be > 1 (so you need more than 1 bit
    to hold it in stencil buffer).

    Why ? It's obvious that *while rendering* (e.g. right after rendering
    all front quads) this value may be > 1. But when the point
    is in the shadow because it's inside more than one shadow
    (cast by 2 different shadow quads) then even *after rendering*
    this point will have value > 1.

    So it's important that this constant spans a couple of bits.
    More precisely, it should be the maximum number of possibly overlapping
    front shadow quads from any possible camera view. Practically speaking,
    it will always be too little (for complicated shadow casters),
    but stencil_wrap will hopefully in this case minimize artifacts. }

    But render only things not in shadow.

    ----------------------------------------
    Long (but maybe educational) explanation why glDepthFunc(GL_LEQUAL)
    below is crucial:

    What should I do with depth buffer ? Now it contains opaque
    never-shadowed things, and all shadowed things.
    At some time (see revision 2048 in Kambi SVN repository on kocury) I called
    glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) before rendering shadowed things for the
    second time. While this seems to work, the 2nd pass leaves the depth-buffer
    untouched on shadowed places. So it creates a whole
    lot of problems for rendering transparent things at the end:
    1. I have to render them before glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT),
       since they can be occluded by any level parts (shadowed on not).
    2. I have to render them once again (but only into depth buffer,
       i.e. with temporary
       glColorMask(GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE))
       after glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT), since they can occlude
       non-shadowed level parts.

    This is easy doable for opaque parts. But what about transparent
    things? In other words, where should we call
    - RenderOnePass with UsingBlending=true, ShadowVolumesReceivers=[false]?
    - RenderOnePass with UsingBlending=true, DisableShadowVolumeCastingLights=false, ShadowVolumesReceivers=[true]?
    They should be rendered but they don't affect depth buffer.
    Well, clearly, they have to be rendered
    before glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) (for the same reason that
    opaque parts must: because they can be occluded by any level
    part, shadowed or not). But rendering non-shadowed parts may then
    cover them (since they cannot be rendered to depth buffer).
    So I should render them once again, but *only at the places
    where Render_Shadowed_Lights below passed the stencil test (=0) and the depth test*.
    But the second condition is not so easy (I would have to change stencil
    buffer once again, based on Level.Render hits).

    The simpler version, to just render them second time everywhere where
    were not in shadow, i.e. stencil test (=0) passes would be no good:
    we would render transparent things twice in the places on the level
    when they are not in shadow.

    So basically, it's all doable, but not trivial, and (more important)
    I'm losing rendering time on handling this. And without taking proper care
    about transparent parts, transparent things
    may be e.g. visible through the walls,
    in the places where shadow falls on the wall.

    This was all talking assuming that we do glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
    before the 2nd pass. But do we really have to ? No!
    It's enough to just set depth test GL_LEQUAL (instead of default
    GL_LESS) and then the 2nd pass will naturally cover the level
    rendered in the 1st pass. That's all, it's easy to implement,
    works perfectly, and is fast.

    End of long explanation about glDepthFunc(GL_LEQUAL).
