      When reading this, you should generally be prepared that length
      of it may be smaller than all sectors of your scene.
      That's because sometimes we don't initialize VisibleSectors fully.

      In this case you should assume that not initialized sector
      indexes are visible. And always you can assume that
      Always Sectors[I].VisibleSectors[I] = @true, i.e. the sector
      is visible from itself (assuming that VisibleSectors has
      enough length to contain I). }

      Adds appropriate waypoints to sectors and sectors to waypoints,
      knowing which waypoint belongs (presumably, lies at the border of)
      to which sector.
      A waypoint belongs to the sector simply when TWaypoint.Box
      collides with one of the sector boxes.

    { This sets Waypoints contents to the list of waypoints
      that must be passed to travel from sector SectorBegin to SectorEnd.

      Special cases: when either SectorBegin or SectorEnd are nil
      (this can easily happen if you pass here results
      of SectorWithPoint method), or when SectorBegin = SectorEnd,
      or when there is no possible way, it returns @false and
      just clears Waypoints (i.e. sets Waypoints.Count to 0).

      Otherwise (if a way is found) it returns @true and sets
      Waypoints items as appropriate. The order of Waypoints
      is significant: starting from SectorBegin, you should
      first travel to Waypoints[0], then to Waypoints[1] etc.
      In this case for sure we have at least one Waypoint.

      (So the result of this function is actually just a comfortable
      thing, you can get the same result just checking
      Waypoints.Count <> 0)

      TODO: This should use breadth-first search.
      Right now it uses depth-first search. For small sectors+waypoints
      graphs it doesn't matter. }
