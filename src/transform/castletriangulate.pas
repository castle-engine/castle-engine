type
  TTriangulatorProc = procedure (const Tri: TVector3Integer) of object;

{ Triangulate potentially non-convex face.

  FaceIndices[0]..FaceIndices[Count - 1] are indices
  to the Vertices array. They describe the outline of the polygon (face).
  You can pass FaceIndices = @nil, this is understood that indices
  are just 0..Count - 1 (in other words, it's equivalent
  to setting FaceIndices[0] = 0, FaceIndices[1] = 1 etc.).

  For each resulting triangle we will call TriangulatorProc
  with Tri (first param of TriangulatorProc) containing indices
  to FaceIndices[] array. We return indices to FaceIndices
  (not ready vectors from Vertices, not even indices to Vertices[] array)
  to allow the caller to obtain all information about the triangle.
  In the simple case, you can just use Vertices[FaceIndices[Tri[0..2]]]
  to obtain your triangle, in the more sophisticated cases you have
  other options to e.g. extract other vertex information from whatever
  data you have (see e.g. VRML/X3D IndexedFaceSet renderer).

  Generated triangles have the same orientation (normal from ccw etc.)
  as original polygon. This also means that if you're sure that
  your polygon is planar (and it should be --- although we handle gracefully
  small deviations from planar, this procedure doesn't actually handle
  arbitrary (dis)located 3D data) then normal vector of all your
  triangles is the same.

  Note that you generally shouldn't use this procedure if you @italic(know)
  that your polygon is convex. Then using this is a waste of time,
  after all convex polygons can be triangulated much easier.
  You can use TriangulateConvexFace in this case, which has
  deliberately very similar interface to this procedure.

  @param(TriangulatorProcData Is just passed unmodified to every
    TriangulatorProc call (as the second parameter). This is standard
    method to pass whatever data to your callback.)

  @param(AddToIndices
    Indexes returned in Tri[0..2] are all incremented by AddToIndices
    (which may also be negative), this is useful if your FaceIndices
    is actually a pointer to the middle of some larger indexes array.
    Just pass 0 if you don't want this.)

{ Triangulate convex polygon.

  This performs very easy triangulation. It has deliberately
  similar interface to TriangulateFace, so it can be used as drop-in
  replacement for TriangulateFace, when you know that your face is
  convex.

  Note that it doesn't even need to know FaceIndices or Vertices,
  it's enough to know Count.

  This also guarantees consequent triangles orientation, like TriangulateFace.

implementation

uses Math,
  CastleLog, CastleStringUtils;

{ Do additional operations (normalize some vectors etc.)
  that in theory should improve numerical stability of this algorithm.
  These operations do not seem to make any impact in practice in our tests.
  Define this if you see problems, and suspect they may be solved by this
  (and if you find a testcase that proves that this is needed, please report,
  so we will make this working always!). }
{ $define TRIANGULATION_EXTRA_STABILITY}

{ Implementation idea based on face2tri.C in C++, from mgflib sources.

  The algorithm works by finding and cutting off "ears" from the polygon.
  "Ear" is a triangle that satisfies:
  1. it has 1 edge inside the polygon and 2 edges along the polygon border and
  2. it can be safely cut off from the polygon (without intersecting any edge).
     Which means that it doesn't contain any other polygon vertex inside.

  When we find an ear, we cut it off, which means
  - we pass the ear triangle to the callback TriangulatorProc,
  - the polygon is shrunk, it has one vertex less: this is done by setting
    Outs (for the corner vertex) to true,
  - and then we repeat the work for the new polygon, smaller by 1 vertex. }

  { Should vertex Border (lying on the border of triangle V0,V1,V2)
    be treated as lying inside this triangle (and causing it non-empty).
    This is the tricky situation: border vertex

    1. *Must* cause EarFound:=false (be considered inside V0,V1,V2) in some cases.

       Consider you have a polygon with 4 vertexes,
       and 1st and 3rd are equal (have equal position).
       So a correct triangulation is 2 degenerated (colinear)
       triangles. But accidentally ignoring the border vertex means
       that we make one non-degenerated incorrect triangle:
       2-3-4 (because 1st vertex will not collide with it,
       as it's equal to 3 so it lies on the border).
       And then we would fail even more, because we're left
       with a triangle (Corners = 3) which has orientation
       reverted from the polygon. So we would make *two* incorrect
       triangles, and spill the "Impossible to find an ear" warning.

    2. *Cannot* cause EarFound:=false (be considered outside V0,V1,V2) in other cases.

       Consider two triangles joined by a single vertex
       (that is, two vertexes with equal positions).
       Clearly, a sensible triangulation exists.
       But if the middle duplicated vertex will be taken into
       account, it will block every possible ear triangle.
       Such shape would not have any possile triangulation.
