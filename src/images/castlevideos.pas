  { Video.

    It can load movie from a sequence of image files.
    With the help of ffmpeg, it can also load any normal movie file format,
    like avi (compressed by anything ffmpeg can handle), OggTheora and
    many others. ffmpeg really handles probably everything you will
    ever want.

    Video is stored simply as a sequence of uncompressed images in memory.
    This is not good for real movies, so don't even try to open
    any real, 2 hour, full dvd resolution movie --- loading will
    take hours and you will clog your memory. This class is @italic(not)
    supposed to be used in a real movie player.

    However, this simple storage is perfect to load a short movie
    for some effect in a game, for example a simple movie with flames
    or smoke to be shown as texture in your 3D game.
    Memory and loading time is acceptable then,
    and you want to prepare all your textures before the game starts anyway
    (for a 3D game, there's no time to decode some movie format while
    playing...).

    See example program
    @code(examples/images_videos/simple_video_editor/)
    in our engine for example of a simple movie player/editor implemented on top
    of this class. }

      Use these only when @link(Loaded) is @true.

      Time is supposed to be in seconds. (Actually, we don't care;
      but when the movie file says to play "25 frames per second", then
      we will make 25 frames per this Time unit. So you probably
      want to count the Time in seconds too.)

      @link(Count) is always >= 1 when the video is loaded.
      That is, we don't allow videos with zero frames (I don't
      know if any movie format allows this.)

    { Number of frames per second for this video.

      For formats with varying frame-rate (although we do not support
      any such format right now), this will be just average frame-rate.
      The idea is that this property is just to show the user, so (s)he
      can judge the quality of the video. }
    property FramesPerSecond: Single read FFramesPerSecond;

    { Loads video from file or URL.

      URL is downloaded using CastleDownload unit.
      As always, if you all you care about is loading normal files, then just pass
      a normal filename (absolute or relative to the current directory)
      as the URL parameter.

      Supported video formats:

      @unorderedList(

        @item(We recognize video URLs by extension, and then try
          to load them through ffmpeg. So ffmpeg must be available
          on $PATH for this. See castle-model-viewer docs for some links.

          Internally, for now we just use ffmpeg to decompose the video to
          single images, and then proceed to load this image sequence.
          So this takes some time and drains memory for longer movies,
          and it's not supposed to be really used to load longer movies.

          Of course, this may get improved (and some simple video formats
          may be handled without ffmpeg dependency) in the future,
          if the need arises. For now, it's enough for me --- all I want
          is to load some simple texture movies (like smoke or fire
          or dense fog animations) to use as billboards in games.
          For such short movies, loading time and memory use are acceptable.)

        @item(We can also load a sequence of images with a URL
          like image@@counter(1).png.

          We use @link(FormatNameCounter) to recognize URLs with
          @code(@@counter(*)) macro. If URL contains @code(@@counter(*)) macro,
          then we try to load image sequence starting from counter equal 0
          or (if that doesn't exist) from counter equal 1.
          This way your image sequence numbering can start from 0 or from 1,
          and it will work in any case.

          If URL doesn't contain @code(@@counter(*)) macro,
          then we just load a single image (and treat it as a movie with only one frame).

          Note that this allows you to have alpha channel for the video.
          Since we just load the sequence of images, they can have
          alpha channel just like any still image (e.g. PNG) can have it.
          So your animated texture of fire / smoke
          etc. will be rendered will all the features of alpha channel
          (blending or alha testing, depending on alpha channel type).
          I don't know if any video file format supports any kind of
          alpha channel, so using image sequence may be actually your
          only choice for videos with alpha channel.)
      )

      Parameters ResizeToX, ResizeToY allow you to resize video frames.
      If one of them is non-zero, the appropriate video size (width and/or
      height) will be resized. Resizing quality is controlled by
      Interpolation parameter. }

      Handled formats: just like LoadFromFile. Also, just like LoadFromFile,
      we need ffmpeg on $PATH to save to any single-file movie format. }
    procedure SaveToFile(const Url: String);

    procedure Resize(const ResizeToX, ResizeToY: Cardinal;
      const Interpolation: TResizeInterpolation = riBilinear);

    { Release all resources allocated by @link(LoadFromFile).
      @link(Loaded) property changes to @false after calling this.

      It's safe to call this even if @link(Loaded) is already @false --- then
      this will do nothing. }
    procedure Close;

    property Loaded: boolean read FLoaded;

    { Play the video in a never-ending loop.

      If @true then IndexFromTime and ImageFromTime will return information
      that causes the video to be played in an infinite loop.
      This cooperates with TimeBackwards:
      If TimeBackwards is also @true, then each loop step will play
      video once forward, and once backward --- infinitely.

      It's Ok to change the value of this property at any time
      (even when video is not yet loaded), since this doesn't really
      cause any internal recalculation. It only affects what
      *FromTime methods return. }
    property TimeLoop: boolean read FTimeLoop write FTimeLoop default false;

    { Play the video backwards after playing it forward.

      This cooperates with TimeLoop. If this is @true and TimeLoop = @false,
      video will be played once forward, once backward, and then stop.
      If this is @true and TimeLoop = also @true, then the video
      will be played forward, then backward, infinitely.

      It's Ok to change the value of this property at any time
      (even when video is not yet loaded), since this doesn't really
      cause any internal recalculation. It only affects what
      *FromTime methods return. }
    property TimeBackwards: boolean
      read FTimeBackwards write FTimeBackwards default false;

    { Mix the video with itself played backwards,
      to force the video to play seamless in a loop.

      This edits the loaded video, such that every frame becomes a mix
      between itself and the corresponding frame from the second half
      of the video. This forces any
      movie to become seamless when played in a loop.

      After this, the movie frames count is halved and TimeBackwards
      is set to @true. This is to conserve memory (and running time of
      this function), since there's no point in keeping both halves of the
      movie anymore --- they are identical (except reversed in time)
      after such operation.

      @italic(Unfortunately, this doesn't look perfect, human eye can easily
      notice the extreme time points (in the middle and at the end),
      when objects in the video reverse their directions etc.
      So the video is seamless, and it's a better trick than just setting
      TimeBackwards := true, but it still doesn't really look good.) }
    procedure MixWithSelfBackwards;

    { Edit the video beginning to fade with the video ending,
      thus forcing the video to play seamless in a loop.

      The idea is to take out last FadeFrames from the video
      (FadeFrames must be >= 0 and <= Count div 2). And then mix
      the beginning of the video, such that the beginning FadeFrames
      frames gradually fade from the original end of video to original
      begin of the video.

      Video must be loaded when using this.

      @raises(EInvalidFadeFrames When FadeFrames is wrong.) }
    procedure FadeWithSelf(FadeFrames: Cardinal);

    { Similar to IndexFromTime, this is a class method that calculates
      frame index using the same algorithm. (Actually, IndexFromTime
      just calls this, but this is implementation detail...).

      The idea is that you can reuse the same algorithm in cases when
      you somehow have the video data but do not have an instance
      of TVideo class.

      In particular, this public for TGLVideo.IndexFromTime,
      TGLVideo.GLTextureFromTime methods. }
    class function FrameIndexFromTime(const Time: TFloatTime;
      const ACount: Integer;
      const AFramesPerSecond: Single;
      const ATimeLoop, ATimeBackwards: boolean): Integer;

    { Alpha channel type of loaded video.
      See TCastleImage.AlphaChannel for precise meaning of this.
      Currently based on the first video image, so it's fast although
      in some cases possibly inaccurate. }
    function AlphaChannel(
      const AlphaTolerance: Byte = DefaultAlphaTolerance): TAlphaChannel;

    procedure FlipHorizontal;
    procedure FlipVertical;
  end;

  { A cache of loaded videos.

    The idea is that instead of creating TVideo instance and calling
    TVideo.LoadFromFile, you instead call
    @code(Video := Cache.Video_IncReference(...)).
    Later, instead of freeing this video, call
    @code(Video_DecReference(Video)). From your point of view, things
    will work the same. But if you expect to load many videos from the
    same URL, then you will get a great speed and memory saving,
    because video will only be actually loaded once. This may happen
    e.g. if you have a VRML / X3D file with lots of MovieTexture nodes
    with the same urls.

    Notes:

    @unorderedList(
      @item(All passed here URLs must be absolute.)

      @item(Note that in case of problems with loading,
        Video_IncReference may raise an exception, just like normal
        TVideo.LoadFromFile. In this case it's guaranteed that no reference will
        be incremented, of course. If Video_IncReference returns
        in a normal way, then it will return something non-@nil for sure.)

      @item(Video_DecReference alwas sets Video to @nil, like FreeAndNil.)

      @item(All videos handled here are always loaded.
        So Video_IncReference always returns TVideo with TVideo.Loaded = @true.
        And you are forbidden from closing this video by TVideo.Close
        yourself.)
    )

    Note that before destroying this object you must free all videos,
    i.e. call Video_DecReference for all videos allocated by
    Video_IncReference. @italic(This class is not a lousy way
    of avoiding memory leaks) --- it would be a bad idea, because it would
    cause sloppy programming, where memory is unnecessarily allocated for
    a long time. In fact, this class asserts in destructor that no videos
    are in cache anymore, so if you compiled with assertions enabled,
    this class does the job of memory-leak detector. }
