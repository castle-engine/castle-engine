# TAbstractX3DViewpointNode.GravityUp
Specify the gravity vector explicitly.

@deprecated

# TTransformNode.Center
Pivot around which the @link(Rotation) and @link(Scale) are performed.

# TTransformNode.Rotation
Rotate the children in 3D, around a given axis by a given angle.
Rotation is done around @link(Center).

# TTransformNode.Scale
Scale in 3D. Scaling is done around @link(Center)
and with orientation given by @link(ScaleOrientation).

We do the best we can to work with @italic(any) scale value,
even negative or zero. But usually, it's best to keep the scale
positive. See the @link(TCastleTransform.Scale) documentation for some
good guidelines about the scale.

# TTransformNode.ScaleOrientation
Orientation in which 3D @link(Scale) is performed.

# TTransformNode.Translation
Translate (move) the children.

# TAbstractShapeNode.Render
Is the shape visible.
See https://castle-engine.io/x3d_implementation_shape_extensions.php#section_ext_shape_render

# TCommonSurfaceShaderNode.DiffuseTexture
The texture controlling the diffuse color, multiplied by @link(DiffuseFactor).

# TCommonSurfaceShaderNode.MultiDiffuseAlphaTexture
The texture controlling the diffuse (rgb) and alpha (alpha channel).
Diffuse color is multiplied by @link(DiffuseFactor), alpha is
(or rather: should be) multiplied by @link(AlphaFactor).

# TCommonSurfaceShaderNode.NormalTexture
Normalmap for bump mapping (the texture controlling the normals).

# TImageBackgroundNode.Texture
Texture displayed in a full-screen quad.
Only 2D single-texture nodes are supported now.
If you leave this as @nil, the image background has no visible effect.

# TImageBackgroundNode.Color
Color that is multiplied by the texture color. Opaque white by default.

Note that the alpha component of this color matters
(just like the alpha channel of the texture in @link(Texture)).
If the resulting image is partially-transparent,
it will be mixed with black color.
