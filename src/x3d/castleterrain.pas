  { Procedural terrain: data from a procedural noise.

    "Synthesized noise" means it's not simply something random.
    We take the noise (integer noise, i.e. hash), smooth it
    (how well, and how fast --- see @link(Interpolation) and @link(Blur)),
    and add several
    functions ("octaves") of such noise (with varying frequency and amplitude)
    together. This is the kind of noise used to synthesize textures,
    terrains and all other procedural stuff.

    @unorderedList(
      @item([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Brownian_motion].
        This is the idea of summing up octaves of noise.
        Ken Musgrave's dissertation has a lot of info and interesting references:
        [http://www.kenmusgrave.com/dissertation.html])

        is blender/source/blender/blenlib/intern/noise.c)

      @item(The simplest practical introduction to the idea is on
        [http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm].
        It describes how to get nice noise very easily, and my approach follows
        theirs.)

      This linearly affects the time for Height call, so don't make
      it too much. Usually ~a few are Ok.

      (The fact that it's a float is just a simple trick to allow smooth
      transitions from x to x+1. In fact, it's executed like
      Trunc(Octaves) * some noises + Frac(Octaves) * some last noise.) }
    property Octaves: Single read FOctaves write FOctaves default 4.0;

    { How noise amplitude changes, when frequency doubles.
      When we double frequency, amplitude is divided by this.
      Smaller values <=> larger frequency noise
      is more visible, so terrain is less smooth (more noisy).

      This is elsewhere called fractal increment, fractal dimension parameter,
      "H", spectral exponent (see e.g. Blender sources, Musgrave's dissertation).
      Do not confuse this with "lacunarity" (how frequency changes in each octave),
      that is simply hardcoded to 2.0 in our code currently.
      In [http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm],
      the inverse of this 1/Smoothness is called "Persistence".

      I decided to call it "Smoothness", since this is the practical
      intuitive meaning.

      Value equal 1.0 means that amplitude doesn't change at all,
      each noise frequency is visible the same, so in effect you will
      just see a lot of noise. And values < 1.0 are really nonsense,
      they make more frequency noise even more visible, which means that
      the terrain is dominated by noise. }

    { How integer noise is interpolated to get smooth float noise.

      Setting this to niNone turns off interpolation, which means that
      your terrain is a sum of a couple of blocky noises --- ugly.

      Using niLinear (means "bilinear", since this is 2D case)
      is also usually bad. Unless you use octaves of really high frequencies,
      usually sharp edges  / flat in-betweens will be visible.

      Using niCosine in right now the best.

      Using niSpline is even better looking
      (usese Catmull-Rom splines,
      which are special case of cubic Hermite spline, see
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline,
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation).
      But it's more time consuming under current implementation. }

      read FInterpolation write SetInterpolation default niCosine;

    { Resulting noise octaves may be blurred. This helps to remove
      the inherent vertical/horizontal directionality in our 2D noise
      (it also makes it more smooth, since that's what blurring is about;
      you may want to increase Frequency * 2 to balance this).

      This is independent from @link(Interpolation). Although the need
      for Blur is most obvious in poor/none interpolation methods
      (none, linear), it also helps for the nicer interpolation methods
      (cosine, cubic).

      Note about [http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm]:
      this "blurring" is called "smoothing" there.
      I call it blurring, as it seems more precise to me. }

    { If non-zero, then we generate terrain using heterogeneous fBm.
      Intuitively, the idea is that the terrain details (from higher octaves)
      are more noisy when ground is higher. This is realistic
      (debris gathers in lower terrain, smoothing it more).

      More precisely, this means that we accumulate multiplied previous noise,
      at each step dividing this accumulated result by Heterogeneous,
      and clamping at 1.0. So when Heterogeneous is very small,
      this always ends up 1.0, and we get normal (homogeneous) generation.
      When Heterogeneous is larger, the details (at lower ground)
      are scaled down (terrain is smoother).

      This is called "threshold" in Musgrave's dissertation (see algorithm
      in section 2.3.2.5 "A Large Scale Terrain Model"). }

  { Terrain data from a grid of values with specified width * height.
    Used when your underlying data is a simple 2D array of
    GridSizeX * GridSizeY heights.

    where the height data is accurate. Everything else is an interpolation

      we return grid values for grid points 0..GridSizeX - 1.
      Outside 0..1 range, we clamp (that is, take nearest value
