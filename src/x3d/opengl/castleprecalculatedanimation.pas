  { A "precalculated" animation done by
    interpolating between a number of 3D model states.

    After constructing an object of this class, you must actually
    load it's animation by calling Load or LoadFromFile or LoadFromEvents
    etc.

    When loading you must provide one or more X3D models with
    their associated times. Animation will show a transition from the first
    model to the last. If models are "structurally equal" then the transition
    between two successive models will be smooth, otherwise a sudden change
    will be shown. "Structurally equal" means
    the same nodes hierarchy, the same names of nodes,
    the same values of all fields (with the exception of fields
    that are floating-point based and so can be interpolated, for example
    SFFloat, SFVec3f and equivalent MFXxx fields).
    For multi-valued fields (MFXxx) that can be interpolated: note that values
    of items may differ, but still the counts of items must be equal.

    This creates a list of @link(Scenes) such that
    @unorderedList(
      @itemSpacing Compact
      @item the first scene on the list is exactly the 1st object
      @item the last scene on the list is exactly the last object
      @item(intermediate scenes are accordingly interpolated between
        the two surrounding "predefined" by you scenes)
    )

    For example, first object may be a small sphere with blue color, the other
    object may be a larger sphere with white color, and the simplest
    times are 0.0 for the 1st scene and 1.0 for the 2nd scene.
    The animation will show the blue sphere growing larger
    and fading into the white
    color. Of course, any kind of models is allowed --- e.g. it can
    be a walking man at various stages, so in effect you get an animation
    of walking man.

    A special case when you pass only one scene to this class is allowed
    (it may be handy in some situations). This will obviously produce
    just a still result, i.e. resulting TCastlePrecalculatedAnimation will be just
    a wrapper around single TCastleScene instance.

      Must be called (this or some other loading routine like LoadFromFile)
      before you do almost anything with this object.
      @link(Loaded) changes to @true after calling this.

      @param(KeyNodes
        Models describing the "predefined" frames of animation.
        They must descend from TX3DRootNode.

        For all nodes except the first: They are @italic(always)
        owned by this class --- that's needed,
        because actually we may do some operations on these models when
        building animation (including even freeing some KeyNodes,
        if we will find that they are equivalent to some other KeyNodes).
        They all must point to different objects.

        You must supply at least one item here (you cannot make an animation
        from 0 items).)

      @param(Times Array specifying the point of time for each "predefined"
        frame. Length of this array must equal to length of KeyNodes array.)

      @param(ScenesPerTime
        This says how many scenes will be used for period of time equal to 1.0.
        This will determine Scenes.Count.
        KeyNodes[0] always takes Scenes[0] and KeyNodes[High(KeyNodes)]
        always takes Scenes[Scenes.High].

        Note that if we will find that some nodes along the way are
        exactly equal, we may drop scenes count between --- because if they are
        both equal, we can simply render the same scene for some period
        of time. This is an optimization, and you shouldn't notice it at all,
        since rendeting will be the same (but less memory-consuming).

        Special value ScenesPerTime = 0 means that you want to have only the
        KeyNodes you explicitly passed in the scene, not more.
        No more intermediate scenes will ever be created.
        This creates a trivial animation that suddenly jumps from
        one RootNode to the next at specified times. It may be useful if you
        already have generated a lot of KeyNodes, densely distributed
        over time, and you don't need TCastlePrecalculatedAnimation to insert any more
        scenes.)

      @param(EqualityEpsilon
        This will be used for comparing fields, to decide if two fields
        (and, consequently, nodes) are equal. It will be simply
        passed to TX3DField.Equals.

        You can pass here 0 to use exact comparison, but it's
        advised to use here something > 0. Otherwise we could waste
        display list memory (and loading time) for many frames of the
        same node that are in fact equal.)

      kanim (described on
      [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/kanim_format.php]).

      If you need more control over loading, for example you want to
      change some parameters at loading (for example, ScenesPerTime
      and EqualityEpsilon of kanim files), you should use
      more flexible (and less comfortable to use)
      LoadFromFileToVars class procedure (specialized for kanim files)

        from the file), sometimes not (e.g. you set suitable values for them
        by code).

      For Time outside the range TimeBegin .. TimeEnd
      behavior depends on TimeLoop and TimeBackwards properties:

          again always the first scene will be returned.

          So between TimeEnd and TimeEnd + TimeDuration
          animation will be played backwards, and

        @item(When TimeLoop and TimeBackwardsm then:

          Outside TimeBegin .. TimeEnd, animation will cycle.
          Cycle between TimeEnd and TimeEnd + TimeDuration will

    { Turn this on to treat specially the case when a single scene (Scenes.Count = 1)
      is loaded: we will set this scene's Static = @false.
      This allows you to enable VRML/X3D events and dynamically change the scene
      in this very special case.
      The normal behavior, when we load many scenes (or when this property is @false),
      is to set all children scenes Static = @true.

      Practically, this is useful only for tools like view3dscene, that want
      to have full VRML/X3D events when possible, and at the same time they want
      to load everything as TCastlePrecalculatedAnimation, for ease of coding.

      To put it simply, just don't use this in normal programs -- it's a hack.

      Although Static can be later changed, but changing it (after loading) to @false
      is expensive (needs ChangedAll, that also recalculates shape tree, forces
      shape octree and other recalculations). That's why this property is needed,
      it sets Static correctly before loading the contents. }

    { Should collision checking check also last animation frame.

      Regardless of this value, we always check collision with the
      first animation frame (FirstScene), of course only when
      FirstScene.OctreeCollisions is initialized, and only if
      @link(GetCollides) (which includes @link(GetExists)).

      When CollisionUseLastScene is @true, we will also check collision
      with the last animation frame's octree, i.e. LastScene.OctreeCollisions.
      (Of course, only if it's initialized, e.g. by adding
      ssDynamicCollisions to the LastScene.Spatial property.)
      So when CollisionUseLastScene, collision checking sees the animation
      as a sum of first and last frames geometry.
      CollisionUseLastScene
      is useful if the object is moving, but the move is very slight,
      so that the sum of first and last scenes geometry is good enough
      approximation of the whole geometry at any point of the animation.

      Although it seems like a totally dumb way to check for collisions,
      it's suitable for many purposes (see e.g. uses on "castle hall" level),
      it's simple and not memory-consuming, and you don't have to take
      any action when animation frame changes (because @link(Time) changes
      don't change the colliding geometry, so the animation is static from
      the point of view of collision checking routines).

      TODO: In the future other collision methods may be available.
      First of all, checking with sum of all bounding boxes, or with particular
      scene time box, should be available. }

      in effect float range TimeDuration would contain one scene less,
      and so when looking at large Time values, the scenes are slightly shifted

      This causes problems when code relies on the meaning of some time
      values. E.g. if TimeBegin = 0, you expect that Time = k * TimeEnd,

      backwards is @true). This is needed for tricks like smooth animations
      concatenation, see "the rift" in RiftCreatures unit.
