  TRenderShapeShadowVolumes = class helper for TShapeShadowVolumes
    { Rendering shadow volumes with silhouette optimization.

      This renders shadow quads of silhouette edge. Edges from ManifoldEdges
      list are used to find silhouette edge. Additionally edges from
      BorderEdges always produce shadow quads, i.e. we treat them
      like they would always be silhouette edges.

      The very idea of this optimization is that most edges are in
      ManifoldEdges and so only real silhouette edges produce shadow quads.
      In other words, BorderEdges list should not contain too many items.
      When BorderEdges contains all edges (ManifoldEdges is empty), then
      this method degenerates to a naive rendering without silhouette
      optimization. So you should try to make your models as much as
      possible resembling nice 2-manifolds. Ideally, if your mesh
      is a number of perfectly closed manifolds, and vertex ordering
      is consistent, then BorderEdges is empty, and this works perfect.

      Usually, most models are mostly 2-manifold (only the real border
      edges are, well, in BorderEdges), and this works great.
      See "VRML engine documentation" on
      [https://castle-engine.io/engine_doc.php],
      chapter "Shadows", for description and pictures of possible artifacts
      when trying to use this on models that are not 2-manifold.)

      LightCap and DarkCap say whether you want to cap your shadow volume.
      LightCap is the cap at the caster position, DarkCap is the cap in infinity.
      This is needed by z-fail method, you should set them both to @true.
      To be more optimal, you can request LightCap only if z-fail @italic(and
      the caster is inside camera frustum). For directional lights, DarkCap is
      ignored, since the volume is always closed by a single point in infinity.

{ Is it worth preparing ManifoldEdges list: yes.

  At the beginning we used here the simple algorithm from
  [http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1873.asp].
  For each triangle with dot > 0, add it to the Edges list
  --- unless it's already there, in which case remove it.
  This way, at the end Edges contain all edges that have on one
  side triangle with dot > 0 and on the other side triangle with dot <= 0.
  In other words, all sihouette edges.
  (This is all assuming that model is 2-manifold,
  so each edge has exactly 2 neighbor triangles).

  But this algorithm proved to be unacceptably slow for many cases.
  While it generated much less shadow quads than naive
  RenderAllShadowVolume, the time spent in detecting the silhouette edges
  made the total time even worse than RenderAllShadowVolume.
  Obviously, that's because we started from the list of triangles,
  without any explicit information about the edges.
  The time of this algorithm was n*m, if n is the number of triangles
  and m the number of edges, and on 2-manifold n*3/2 = m so
  the time is n^2. Terrible, if you take complicated shadow caster.

  To make this faster, we have to know the connections inside the model:
  that's what ManifoldEdges list is all about. It allows us to
  implement this in time proportional to the number of edges.

    { Comments for Opaque/TransparentTrianglesBegin/End:

      It's crucial to set glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) for LightCap.
      This way we get proper self-shadowing. Otherwise, LightCap would
      collide in z buffer with the object itself.

      Setting glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) for DarkCap also is harmless and OK.
      Proof: if there's anything on this pixel, then indeed the depth test
      would fail. If the pixel is empty (nothing was rasterized there),
      then the depth test wouldn't fail... but also, in this case value in
      stencil buffer will not matter, it doesn't matter if this pixel
      is in shadow or not because there's simply nothing there.

      And it allows us to render both LightCap and DarkCap in one
      GL_TRIANGLES pass, in one iteration over Triangles list, which is
      good for speed.

      Some papers propose other solution:
        glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL);
        glPolygonOffset(1, 1);
      but this is no good for use, because it cannot be applied
      to DarkCap (otherwise DarkCap in infinity (as done by ExtrudeVertex)
      would go outside of depth range (even for infinite projection,
      as glPolygonOffset works already after the vertex is transformed
      by projection), and this would make DarkCap not rendered
      (outside of depth range)).

      If you consider that some shadow casters and receivers may
      be partially transparent (that is, rendered without writing
      to depth buffer) then the above reasoning is not so simple:

      - There's no way to handle transparent
        objects (that are not recorded in depth buffer) as shadow receivers.
        Rendering them twice with blending would result in wrong blending
        modes applied anyway. So TGLShadowVolumeRenderer.Render renders them
        at the end, as last pass.

        This means that "glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) for DarkCap" is still
        Ok: if on some pixel there was only transparent object visible,
        then stencil value of this pixel is wrong, but transparent object
        will never be rendered in shadowed state --- so it will not
        look at stencil value.

        For LightCap, situation is worse. Even if the transparent
        object is only shadow caster (not receiver), still problems
        may arise due to glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER): imagine you have
        a transparent object casting shadow on non-transparent object
        (see e.g. demo_models/shadow_volumes/ghost_shadow.wrl).
        This means that you can look through the shadow casting
        (transp) object and see shadow receiving (opaque) object,
        that may or may not be in shadow on speciic pixel.
        Which means that glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) is wrong for LightCap:
        the transparent object doesn't hide the shadow on the screen,
        and the depth test shouldn't fail. Which means that for transparent
        objects, we cannot do glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER).

      - What to do?

        The trick
          glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL);
          glPolygonOffset(1, 1);
        makes light cap rendering working for both transparent and opaque
        objects, but it's not applicable to dark cap. Moreover,
        using glPolygonOffset always feels dirty.

        Solution: we decide to handle transparent objects separately.
        We note that for transparent shadow casters
        actually no tweaks to caps rendering should be done.
        No glPolygonOffset, no glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) needed: light cap
        should be tested as usual. (Since transparent object is not written
        to depth buffer, it will not collide in depth buffer with it's
        light cap).

        This means that is we'll just split triangles list into
        transparent and opaque ones, then the only complication needed
        is to switch glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) trick *off* for transparent
        triangles. And all works fast.

      - There's actually one more note: for transparent objects,
        caps are always needed (even with zpass).
        Note that this means that whole 2-manifold part must have
        caps.

        This also means that joining one 2-manifold path from some transparent
        and some opaque triangles will not work. (as then some parts
        may have caps (like transparent ones) and some note
        (like opaque ones with zpass)).

  But this algorithm proved to be unacceptably slow for many cases.
  While it generated much less shadow quads than naive
  RenderAllShadowVolume, the time spent in detecting the silhouette edges
  made the total time even worse than RenderAllShadowVolume.
  Obviously, that's because we started from the list of triangles,
  without any explicit information about the edges.
  The time of this algorithm was n*m, if n is the number of triangles
  and m the number of edges, and on 2-manifold n*3/2 = m so
  the time is n^2. Terrible, if you take complicated shadow caster.

  To make this faster, we have to know the connections inside the model:
  that's what ManifoldEdges list is all about. It allows us to
  implement this in time proportional to the number of edges.

    { Comments for Opaque/TransparentTrianglesBegin/End:

      It's crucial to set glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) for LightCap.
      This way we get proper self-shadowing. Otherwise, LightCap would
      collide in z buffer with the object itself.

      Setting glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) for DarkCap also is harmless and OK.
      Proof: if there's anything on this pixel, then indeed the depth test
      would fail. If the pixel is empty (nothing was rasterized there),
      then the depth test wouldn't fail... but also, in this case value in
      stencil buffer will not matter, it doesn't matter if this pixel
      is in shadow or not because there's simply nothing there.

      And it allows us to render both LightCap and DarkCap in one
      GL_TRIANGLES pass, in one iteration over Triangles list, which is
      good for speed.

      Some papers propose other solution:
        glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL);
        glPolygonOffset(1, 1);
      but this is no good for use, because it cannot be applied
      to DarkCap (otherwise DarkCap in infinity (as done by ExtrudeVertex)
      would go outside of depth range (even for infinite projection,
      as glPolygonOffset works already after the vertex is transformed
      by projection), and this would make DarkCap not rendered
      (outside of depth range)).

      If you consider that some shadow casters and receivers may
      be partially transparent (that is, rendered without writing
      to depth buffer) then the above reasoning is not so simple:

      - There's no way to handle transparent
        objects (that are not recorded in depth buffer) as shadow receivers.
        Rendering them twice with blending would result in wrong blending
        modes applied anyway. So TGLShadowVolumeRenderer.Render renders them
        at the end, as last pass.

        This means that "glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) for DarkCap" is still
        Ok: if on some pixel there was only transparent object visible,
        then stencil value of this pixel is wrong, but transparent object
        will never be rendered in shadowed state --- so it will not
        look at stencil value.

        For LightCap, situation is worse. Even if the transparent
        object is only shadow caster (not receiver), still problems
        may arise due to glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER): imagine you have
        a transparent object casting shadow on non-transparent object
        (see e.g. demo_models/shadow_volumes/ghost_shadow.wrl).
        This means that you can look through the shadow casting
        (transp) object and see shadow receiving (opaque) object,
        that may or may not be in shadow on speciic pixel.
        Which means that glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) is wrong for LightCap:
        the transparent object doesn't hide the shadow on the screen,
        and the depth test shouldn't fail. Which means that for transparent
        objects, we cannot do glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER).

      - What to do?

        The trick
          glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL);
          glPolygonOffset(1, 1);
        makes light cap rendering working for both transparent and opaque
        objects, but it's not applicable to dark cap. Moreover,
        using glPolygonOffset always feels dirty.

        Solution: we decide to handle transparent objects separately.
        We note that for transparent shadow casters
        actually no tweaks to caps rendering should be done.
        No glPolygonOffset, no glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) needed: light cap
        should be tested as usual. (Since transparent object is not written
        to depth buffer, it will not collide in depth buffer with it's
        light cap).

        This means that is we'll just split triangles list into
        transparent and opaque ones, then the only complication needed
        is to switch glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER) trick *off* for transparent
        triangles. And all works fast.

      - There's actually one more note: for transparent objects,
        caps are always needed (even with zpass).
        Note that this means that whole 2-manifold part must have
        caps.

        This also means that joining one 2-manifold path from some transparent
        and some opaque triangles will not work. (as then some parts
        may have caps (like transparent ones) and some note
        (like opaque ones with zpass)).

        TODO: implement above.
