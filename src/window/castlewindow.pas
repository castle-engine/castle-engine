{ Window with rendering context suitable for rendering of "Castle Game Engine".
  Provides a window that can render hierarchy of TCastleUserInterface,
  which includes a hierarchy of 3D and 2D scenes inside TCastleViewport.
  Use the @link(TCastleWindow) as your window class.

  @link(Application) object (instance of class @link(TCastleApplication))
  is a central manager of all open @link(TCastleWindow) windows.

  Using this unit:

  @orderedList(
    @item(Declare and create @link(TCastleWindow) instance. (Or a descendant
      like @link(TCastleWindow).))

    @item(Assign Window properties and callbacks like
      @link(TCastleWindow.OnRender OnRender),
      @link(TCastleWindow.OnResize OnResize),
      @link(TCastleWindow.Width Width),
      @link(TCastleWindow.Height Height),
      @link(TCastleWindow.Caption Caption).)

    @item(To initialize your game, you usually want to use
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize).

      If you only care about
      standalone programs (for normal OSes like Linux, Windows, MacOSX,
      but not Android) you may also just initialize your game in the main
      program block, although using
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize)
      is still often comfortable.)

    @item(Call @link(TCastleWindow.Open Window.Open),
      this will actually show the window and it's
      associated OpenGL context.

      The first window open calls
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize).
      It also calls
      @link(TCastleWindow.OnOpen OnOpen) and
      @link(TCastleWindow.OnResize OnResize) callbacks.)

    @item(Call @link(TCastleApplication.Run Application.Run).
      This will enter message loop that will call
      appropriate windows' callbacks at appropriate times
      (OnRender, OnPress, OnRelease, OnResize, OnUpdate and many more).
      There are also some Application callbacks, like
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnUpdate Application.OnUpdate).

      For more advanced needs you can use something like

      @longCode(#
        while Application.ProcessMessage do <something>;
      #)

      instead of Application.Run.

      You can also call @link(TCastleWindow.OpenAndRun Window.OpenAndRun),
      this is just a shortcut for Window.Open + Application.Run.)

    @item(Application.Run ends when you call @link(TCastleApplication.Quit Application.Quit)
      or when you close last visible window using @link(TCastleWindow.Close Close(true)).

      User is also allowed to close a window using WindowManager facilities
      (clicking on "X" button in the frame corner, pressing Alt+F4 or something
      like that). By default, such user action will make window close
      (but you can freely customize what your program does when user
      tries to close the window using callback
      @link(TCastleWindow.OnCloseQuery OnCloseQuery)).)
  )

  So the simplest example of using this unit can look like this:

  @longcode(#
    uses CastleWindow;

    var
      Window: TCastleWindow;

    procedure Render(Sender: TCastleContainer);
    begin
      // ... e.g. DrawRectangle or TDrawableImage.Draw calls inside
    end;

    begin
      Window := TCastleWindow.Create(Application);
      Window.OnResize := @Resize;
      Window.Caption := 'Simplest CastleWindow example';
      Window.OpenAndRun;
    end.
  #)

  @italic(More component-like approach):
  For larger programs, it makes more sense to divide functionality into
  controls, which are classes descending from TCastleUserInterface.
  You can override TCastleUserInterface methods to render, capture input and so on
  (see e.g. @link(TCastleUserInterface.Render),
  @link(TCastleUserInterface.Press),
  @link(TCastleUserInterface.Update).)
  You can then add your control to the TCastleWindow.Controls list.

  Some features list:

  @unorderedList(

    @item(TCastleApplication.ProcessMessage method.
      This allows you to reimplement
      event loop handling, which is crucial for implementing things
      like @link(MessageInputQuery) function that does modal GUI dialog box.)

    @item(TCastleWindow.Pressed to easily and reliably check which keys
      are pressed.)

    @item(Application speed, see @link(TCastleWindow.Fps),)

    @item(A menu bar under WinAPI and GTK backends.

      You can attach a menu to a window. Menu structure is constructed using
      various descendants of TMenuEntry class.
      Then you have to assign such menu structure
      to TCastleWindow.MainMenu property. When CastleWindow is implemented on top
      of GTK_2 or WINAPI or LCL we will show this menu and call
      TCastleWindow.OnMenuClick when user clicks some menu item.
      Other backends (XLIB for now) ignore MainMenu.

      See @code(examples/window/window_menu/)
      for an example how to use the menu.)

    @item(Changing screen resolution and bit depth,
      see TCastleApplication.VideoChange.)

    @item(You can request OpenGL context properties:
      @unorderedList(
        @item color buffer
        @item with alpha channel (@link(TCastleWindow.AlphaBits AlphaBits)),
        @item stencil buffer (@link(TCastleWindow.StencilBits StencilBits)),
        @item double buffer (@link(TCastleWindow.DoubleBuffer DoubleBuffer)),
        @item(multisampling (full-screen antialiasing) buffers (by
          @link(TCastleWindow.MultiSampling MultiSampling) or higher-level
          @link(TCastleWindow.AntiAliasing AntiAliasing)))
      )
    )

    @item(You can use native modal dialogs for things such as file selection.
      GTK backend will use GTK dialogs, WinAPI backend
      will use Windows dialog boxes, XLib backend will fall back
      on CastleMessages text input.

      See TCastleWindow.FileDialog (for opening and saving files) and
      TCastleWindow.ColorDialog (for choosing RGB colors).)

    @item(TCastleWindow.ParseParameters method allows you to easily initialize TCastleWindow
      properties like initial size and position using command-line
      parameters like @code(@--geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT), @code(@--display) etc.)
  )

      It's advised (although not totally required) that all errors during
      CloseBackend should be caught and cause only WritelnWarning.
      Reasoning: Close should, regardless of trouble, try to finalize as much
      as possible. }
    procedure CloseBackend;

    { Make the OpenGL context of this window current (active for following
      OpenGL commands). }
    procedure BackendMakeCurrent;

    { Swap OpenGL buffers.
      Call this method only when DoubleBuffered and if you already did
      MakeCurrent. (Implicit glFlush is guaranteed.) }
    procedure SwapBuffers;

    { BackendMenuInitialize should cause backend to build whole menu resources
      for MainMenu, BackendMenuFinalize to free them.

      BackendMenuFinalize is called before changing MainMenu structure
      in arbitrary way, BackendMenuInitialize is called after.
      Backend should just free / initialize resources related to menu.
      BackendMenuInitialize may assume that BackendMenuFinalize was already called
      (so no need to try to free in BackendMenuInitialize again).

      They are never called directly: always call MenuInitialize / Finalize.
      These make sure to care about eventual MenuUpdateBegin / MenuUpdateEnd
      around, and make sure BackendMenuFinalize is called only when menu is
      already initialized (by BackendMenuInitialize), and
      BackendMenuInitialize is called only when menu is not initialized yet.

      Implementation of these can assume that MainMenu <> nil now,
      and that MainMenuVisible = @true.
      Also it may assume that Closed = false.

      Note: if backend wants, it may itself call these from
      OpenBackend / CloseBackend. Of course, when you call them
      yourself, you have to make sure on your own that all assumptions
      are satisfied. In practice, BackendMenuFinalize should clear all the variables
      to the state right after constructor (zero, nil etc.),
      and BackendMenuInitialize expect them as such, and then everything will work Ok.

      @groupBegin }
    procedure BackendMenuInitialize;

    { These call corresponding BackendMenuInitialize or BackendMenuFinalize,
      unless we're inside MenuUpdateBegin / MenuUpdateEnd,
      and take care to only initialize when finalized,
      and finalize only when initialized.
      They also take care of checking Closed and MainMenuVisible properties.
      @groupBegin }

    { Notification called immediately after menu entry properties changed.
      This is called only when MainMenu <> nil and Entry is contained
      inside our MainMenu. Also, this is called only when not Closed.

      In case of MenuUpdateXxx calls: You can be sure that
      only appropriate local Entry properties changed, no other menu entry
      (even child menu entry for submenus) was changed.

      Sloppy backend may simply do here MenuFinalize + MenuInitialize,
      but a better backend may do something more efficient,
      like updating only this specific Entry resources.

      In case of MenuInsert: remember that this is called
      after Entry was added to Parent. So if your MenuInsert simply
      calls MenuFinalize + MenuInitialize, make sure your MenuFinalize
      handles the case that some TMenuEntry may have uninitialized (zero)
      TMenuEntry.Handle.

      In case of MenuDelete: remember that this is called
      after Entry was removed from Parent. So if your MenuDelete simply
      calls MenuFinalize + MenuInitialize, make sure your MenuFinalize
      finalizes (releases backend-specific resources) also for Entry
      that isn't in the MainMenu hierarchy anymore.

      Both MenuInsert and MenuDelete problems disappear if your
      MenuFinalize doesn't look at MainMenu.Entries hierarchy, and releases
      in one go whole backend-specific hierarchy under MainMenu.Handle.
      Or if you implement MenuInsert and MenuDelete in a more optimal way,
      without MenuFinalize + MenuInitialize.

      all keys and mouse buttons.

      - If @true, and in DoKeyDown we get some key event that specifies menu item,
        then DoKeyDown calls DoMenuClick (and not calls EventKeyDown).

      - If @false, then DoKeyDown doesn't check whether key corresponds to menu item.
        It just calls EventKeyDown. }
    function RedirectKeyDownToMenuClick: boolean;

    { DoXxx methods ------------------------------------------------------------

      DoXxx method should be called by CastleWindow backend when an event
      Xxx happens. DoXxx methods take care of various backend-independent
      stuff, and take care of calling EventXxx (that calls OnXxx in turn).
      CastleWindow backend should never call EventXxx directly.
      (And nothing should call OnXxx directly except EventXxx.)

      Remember that no DoXxx may be called from CloseBackend.

      Below is the detailed specification, but summing some things up
      you don't have to worry about these things when you use DoXxx methods
      (these things are fully handled by DoXxx methods):
      - updating state of MousePressed
      - updating state of Pressed (Pressed.Keys, Pressed.Characters etc.)
      - updating state of MousePosition
      - calling MakeCurrent before every EventXxx
      - flushing gl commands (and swapping gl buffers when DoubleBuffer'ing)
      - taking care of AutoRedisplay
      - updating Width, Height (and updating it with accordance to
        Min/MaxWidth/Height and ResizeAllowed)
      - checking MainMenu.Enabled
    }

    { DoResize with FirstResizeAfterOpen = true is called only once
      (and exactly once) from TCastleWindow.Open implementation.
      So all CastleWindow-backend code should always
      pass FirstResizeAfterOpen = false (EVEN if it may be called from
      OpenBackend (that is called before DoResize in Open) !).

      Some more notes about calling DoResize from OpenBackend:
      in this case DoResize will NOT call EventResize (since the first callback
      that should be called for a window is EventOpen). We will always after
      EventOpen call DoResize(..., true), so this should not be a problem
      anywhere. You can simply call DoResize from OpenBackend to tell us what
      real Width/Height we have, and the real EventResize will be called
      just at a later time.

      You can pass here ANY AWidth, AHeight. It will be automatically clipped
      here to fit in Min/MaxWidth/Height and to satisfy ResizeAllowed.

      Also MakeCurrent + EventResize will be called (probably; sometimes
      DoResize may decide to not call EventResize - e.g. when ResizeAllowed
      =raNotAllowed and FirstTime = false then it's useless to call here
      EventResize).

      Remember: this function does not automatically call Invalidate.
      You must make sure that soon after changing size of the window
      you will call DoRender (e.g. you can call Invalidate after
      calling DoResize; but usually (under WinAPI, Xlib, GTK)
      it's not needed, i.e. WinAPI, Xlib, and GTK all take care of this
      automatically). }
    procedure DoResize(AWidth, AHeight: integer; FirstResizeAfterOpen: boolean);

    { Called by a backend when user wants to close the window
      (e.g. by pressing the special "close" button on the window manager border).
      It is possible to ignore it (see OnCloseQuery docs).
      This calls OnCloseQuery and then eventually Close
      (and Close will execute OnClose, CloseBackend etc.).

      Note that there is no "DoClose" method defined.
      You should always call DoCloseQuery. }
    procedure DoCloseQuery;

         EventBeforeRender,
         EventRender (inside Fps._RenderBegin/End)
         flush gl command pipeline (and swap gl buffers if DoubleBuffer)

      - Take care of AutoRedisplay, like

          @code(if AutoRedisplay then Invalidate;)

        So specific CastleWindow backends need not to worry about
        AutoRedisplay. They only have to call this when Invalidated = @true. }
    procedure DoRender;

    { DoKeyDown/Up: pass here key that is pressed down or released up.

      Only DoKeyDown: pass also KeyString. Pass Key = keyNone if this is not

      as char. But never pass both Key = keyNone and KeyString = ''
      (this would mean that nothing is pressed, at least nothing that can be represented
      in CGE).

      Only DoKeyUp: never pass Key = keyNone.

      If you call DoKeyUp while (not Pressed[Key]) it will be ignored
      (will not do any EventRelease etc. - just NOOP).

      This will
         update Pressed (Pressed.Keys, Pressed.Characters, etc.) accordingly,
         DoKeyDown: may here call DoMenuClick

      On the other hand, you cannot allow this if you want to do some
      things continuously, regardless of user input.

    { Size of the window OpenGL area. Together with frame and border
      sizes, and eventually menu bar size, this determines the final
      window size.

      When the window is open, these are read-only (may only change
      through internal methods, that is: we'll update @link(Width), @link(Height),
      @link(Left), @link(Top) to reflect current size and position).

      MinWidth / MaxWidth / MinHeight / MaxHeight place constraints
      on these values (rigorously honored when window is open):
      always @code(MinWidth <= Width <= MaxWidth) and
      @code(MinHeight <= Height <= MaxHeight).

      ResizeAllowed places constrains when window manager and user may change
      window size. In particular, when ResizeAllowed <> raAllowed then
      window sizes cannot change when window is open.

      Note that for some window managers, we cannot always reliably
      force the size constraints and block resizing on the desktop.
      If you set rigorous size constraints, or ResizeAllowed <> raAllowed,
      you may find that window manager still resizes the window.
      In such cases, we may fake our size a little ---
      @link(Width) and @link(Height) values may not correspond to actual
      size as seen on the desktop. This is comfortable, as in such cases
      you usually want to just ignore window managers limits and just
      proceed as if your size requirements are satisfied.

      A fullscreen window has @link(Width), @link(Height), @link(Left), @link(Top)
      set to fill the whole screen.
      The window style is also, if possible, borderless.

      The window size constraints (like MinWidth, MaxWidth, MinHeight, MaxHeight
      and ResizeAllowed) are ignored, that is: we do not check whether
      screen size fits inside MinWidth and MaxWidth. If this is @true,
      the window is always fullscreen.
      However, the sizes visible to your application
      (exposed in properties @link(Width), @link(Height))
      are still constrained by MinWidth, MaxWidth, MinHeight, MaxHeight
      and ResizeAllowed.

      It is best to adjust this property before the window is open,
      this way window will be immediately open in the full-screen size.
      In the standard case (see https://castle-engine.io/manual_cross_platform.php
      about a typical initialization) you should place
      @code(Window.FullScreen := true) inside the unit initialization section.

      When 0, the default window system color precision will be used.

      You can either set them by separate red / green / blue properties.
      Or you can use ColorBits that reads / writes all three channels bits.
      Reading ColorBits simply returns the sum of
      @code(RedBits + GreenBits + BlueBits).
      Writing ColorBits simply set RedBits and BlueBits to
      @code(ColorBits div 3), and sets GreenBits to the remainder.
      This way green channel has always the best resolution (as is usual,
      since it's perceived most), and the sum is always as requested.
      This way setting ColorBits to values like 16 or 24 works as expected.

      Note that it's also possible to change color resolution by
      changing the whole screen settings.
      See TCastleApplication.VideoColorBits and TCastleApplication.VideoChange for this.
      These properties only request the color
      resolution for this window, which is less intrusive (you don't change
      the whole screen) but also may have a smaller chance of success.

          the window size becomes constant. From the first EventResize
          (OnResize) the window size is constant, as long as the window
          remains open.

          You can be sure that EventResize (OnResize) will be called only

          the most flexibility.

    { OpenGL context is created, initialize things that require OpenGL
      context. Often you do not need to use this callback (engine components will
      automatically create/release OpenGL resource when necessary).
      You usually will also want to implement Window.OnClose callback that
      should release stuff you create here.

      Often, instead of using this callback, it's cleaner to derive new classes
      from TCastleUserInterface class or it's descendants,
      and override their GLContextOpen / GLContextClose methods to react to
      context being open/closed. Using such TCastleUserInterface classes
      is usually easier, as you add/remove them from controls whenever
      you want (e.g. you add them in
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize)),
      and underneath they create/release/create again the OpenGL resources
      when necessary.

      OnOpen is always called @bold(after)
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize).
      In normal circumstances, for a typical standalone game, the OnOpen will
      happen only once. But for other targets, it may be necessary to close/reopen
      the OpenGL context many times, e.g. on mobile platforms it's normal
      that application may "loose" the OpenGL context and it may need
      to recreate OpenGL resources when it wakes up.
      Event called when OpenGL context is initialized.

      It's guaranteed that every newly opened window will get
      EventOpen (OnOpen) first, and then EventResize (OnResize),
      and only then --- the other callbacks, as the user uses the window.
      This is consistent EventOpen (OnOpen)
      is always the first executed callback and OnClose
      is always the last. This allows you to cleanly initialize / finalize
      OpenGL resources.

      During EventOpen (OnOpen) you already have valid
      Width / Height values, that is those values were already adjusted
      if ResizeAllowed <> raNotAllowed.

      @bold(Be careful what you do in this callback if you want your game
      to work on Android or other non-standalone platforms.)
      On Android, OpenGL context may be closed and opened at any time,
      as user can switch from/to your application at any time.
      You should use
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize)
      for a one-time initialization (it is executed right before
      the very first OnOpen would be executed).
      Use this callback only to create OpenGL resources
      (destroyed in OnClose).

      and you got 16-bits stencil buffer: StencilBits value will still remain 8.
      This is sensible in case you close the window, tweak some settings

      Setting @link(AntiAliasing) will also set this property.

      1 means that no multi-sampling is required.
      Values larger than 1 mean that we require OpenGL context with
      multi-sampling capabilities. Various GPUs may support various
      values (it's a trade-off between quality and speed),
      try typical values 2 or 4.

      You can enable/disable anti-aliasing in your program by code like

      @longCode(#

        if GLFeatures.Multisample then glDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
      #)

      But usually that's not needed, as it is "on" by default
      (GL_ARB_multisample spec says so) if you requested multi-sampling context
      (that is, if this property is > 1). See GL_ARB_multisample spec for details:
      [http://opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/multisample.txt].

      TOpenGLControl.MultiSampling, and also be more comfortable --- to retry
      initialization with no multi-sampling. In this case this property will
      not be changed, to be nice.

      You can always read OpenGL GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS_ARB and GL_SAMPLES_ARB

      more comfortable. You don't have to wonder what are the sensible
      values of @link(MultiSampling) for common GPUs, and we also

    (*Should this window be actually displayed on the desktop.
      In all normal programs you want to leave this as @true, as the
      main purpose of the window is to actually be visible and interactive
      on the desktop.

      Setting this to @false allows you to get an OpenGL context without
      showing anything on the desktop. This can be used for rendering
      and capturing OpenGL stuff without showing it on the desktop.
      One example is the @--screenshot option of view3dscene, see
      [https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php#section_screenshot].

      If you implement such thing, remember that you should not render
      and capture the normal front or back buffer contents.
      OpenGL makes no guarantee that a hidden window will have any allocated
      memory, so capturing hidden window contents isn't useful (you may
      get something valid, or you may get random / blank screen, depending
      on OS and GPU). However, you can create Framebuffer Object
      on modern GPUs, and capture it's contents. An example code snippet:

      e.g. after creating a window, after resizing a window, after uncovering

      The only difference between these two events is that
      time spent in EventBeforeRender (OnBeforeRender)
      is NOT counted as "frame time"
      by Fps.OnlyRenderFps. This is useful when you have something that needs
      to be done from time to time right before OnRender and that is very
      time-consuming. It such cases it is not desirable to put such time-consuming
      task inside OnRender because this would cause a sudden big change in

    { Called when user releases a pressed key or mouse button.

      It's called right after @code(Pressed[Key]) changed from true to false.

      The TInputPressRelease structure, passed as a parameter to this event,
      contains the exact information what was released.

      Note that reporting characters for "key release" messages is not
      perfect, as various key combinations (sometimes more than one?) may lead
      to generating given character. We have some intelligent algorithm
      for this, used to make Characters table and to detect
      this C for OnRelease callback. The idea is that a character is released
      when the key that initially caused the press of this character is
      also released.

      This solves in a determined way problems like
      "what happens if I press Shift, then X,
      then release Shift, then release X". (will "X" be correctly
      released as pressed and then released? yes.
      will small "x" be reported as released at the end? no, as it was never
      pressed.) }
    property OnRelease: TInputPressReleaseEvent read GetOnRelease write SetOnRelease;

    { Called when user tries to close the window.
      This is called when you use window manager features to close the window,
      like clicking on the "close" icon on the window frame or using Alt+F4
      on most desktops. This is @italic(not) called when you explicitly
      close the window by calling the @link(Close) method.

      When this callback is not assigned, we will
      just let the window be closed. When it's assigned,
      the window will not closed --- you should call here @link(Close)
      explicitly if you want to (for example, after asking user for
      confirmation "do you really want to quit?").

      When handling this event, you must remember that user
      may try to close our window at any time.
      E.g. if you're implementing here somehing like showing user
      text "You cannot quit now" or asking user "Do you really want to quit"
      remember that while you display such message to user and you're
      processing events (e.g. looking for keypress "Yes" or "No"),
      user may try to close your window again.

      CastleMessages unit offers some nice routines that you can safely
      use here, e.g. you can use it inside OnCloseQuery like

        if MessageYesNo(Window, 'Are you sure you want to quit?') then
         Close;

      Inside MessageYesNo, when we're processing events,
      and waiting for user's answer (yes or no),
      futher OnCloseQuery events will be ignored, so everything will work OK.

      This event is also useful if you want to call Close(false)
      on closing the window (i.e. QuitWhenLastWindowClosed = false).
      By default, if this event is undefined, we call Close(true)
      when user tries to close the window. }

      @link(TCastleApplication.OnUpdate Application.OnUpdate) is called.

      You should add code to this window's OnUpdate event
      (not to TCastleApplication.OnUpdate) when you do something related
      to this window. For example when you check this window's
      @link(Pressed) keys state, or animate something displayed on this window.
      This allows various "modal boxes" and such (see CastleMessages)

        If it's not possible to obtain
        OpenGL context with specified attributes.
        For example, maybe you set AlphaBits, DepthBits, StencilBits
        properties too high?

        It's guaranteed that when EGLContextNotPossible
        is raised, the window remains in correct (closed) state.
        This means that you can catch EGLContextNotPossible
        and lower some OpenGL buffer requirements and try to open once again.
        Although it's usually more comfortable to use the overloaded
        version of @link(Open) with Retry callback for this purpose.

        This parameterless version of Open automatically
        turns off multi-sampling (AntiAliasing and MultiSampling
        properties), and then we turn off
        stencil buffer (StencilBits), if OpenGL context cannot be initialized.
        But if it still cannot be initialized, we raise EGLContextNotPossible.
        You can use overloaded Open version with Retry callback to customize
        this fallback mechanism, to code which OpenGL context features
        may be turned off.)
    }

    { Open the window with OpenGL context, allowing you to lower
      the OpenGL context requirements and retry.

      If the OpenGL context cannot be initialized,

      @unorderedList(
        @item(lower some context requirements (like set MultiSampling to 1
          if it was > 1) if possible, and return @true to retry, or)

      Note that the parameterless version of @link(Open) method

      that turns off AntiAliasing and MultiSampling, and then StencilBits
      (since all our engine code should be ready that multi-sampling
      or stencil buffers may not be available).
      Using your own Retry callback, with this version,
      allows you to decide which context parameters may be lowered
      to allow creating a window.

      This dialog may also allow user for some typical file-management
      operations by the way (create some directories, rename some files etc.).

      Returns @true and sets URL accordingly if user chooses some
      file and accepts it. Returns @false if user cancels.

      @param(Title A dialog title.)

      @param(URL Specifies default file as an URL (or simple filename).

        In short, things are designed such that for normal file viewers,
        you can give here the URL of last opened file, or '' if none.

        This URL can be absolute or relative, may include a path, may include a name.
        If you specify only a path (remember to end it with the slash),
        then it's the default path where to save the file.
        If you specify the name (component after final slash), then it's the
        proposed file name for saving (for OpenDialog, this proposed file name
        is ignored, since that's more natural for open dialogs).

        Empty value ('') always means the same as "current directory", guaranteed.
        So it's equivalent to @code(URICurrentPath).

        Note that the path must end with a slash. Otherwise '/tmp/blah' would be
        ambigous (it could mean either file name 'blah' in the dir '/tmp/' dir,
        or dir '/tmp/blah' without a proposed file name).)

            the only 100% sure way to know that the file can be opened and read
            is to actually try to do it.

            To directly read a file (as a stream) from the obtained URL
            you should usually use our CastleDownload.Download function.
            This way you get a readable stream and you
            automatically support loading data from the other protocols (http,

            a warning like @italic("Are you sure you want to overwrite this file?").

            The intention is that directory of the returned file should exist,
            and you should be able to write files there.
            But, again, there is no 100% guarantee about it.
            The only way to be sure whether you can save a file is to actually
            try to do it.

            To directly write to a file (as a stream) to the obtained URL
            you should usually use our URLSaveStream.)
        )
      )

      @param(FileFilters A set of file filters to present to user.
        Pass @nil (default) if you do not want to use file file filters,

        allows you to pass file filters encoded in a single string,
        this may be slightly more comfortable for call, see
        TFileFilterList.AddFiltersFromString

    { Process messages from the window system.
      You have to call this repeatedly to process key presses,
      mouse events, redraws and everything else.
      Messages are processed and appropriate window callbacks are called,
      like TCastleWindow.OnRender,
      TCastleWindow.OnUpdate,
      TCastleWindow.OnKeyPress and many others.

      For simple programs calling the @link(Run) method is usually
      the best solution, @link(Run) just calls ProcessMessage in a loop.
      Manually using the ProcessMessage method allows you to implement
      modal dialog boxes (generally any kind of "display something
      until something happens" behavior). Make your own event loop like this:

      @longCode(#
        while not SomethingHappened do
          Application.ProcessMessages(...);
      #)

      This can used to implement routines that wait until a modal dialog box
      returns, like @link(MessageOK) or @link(MessageYesNo).

      For comfort, returns @code(not Terminated).
      So it returns @true if we should continue, that is
      if @code(Terminate) method was not called (directly or by closing
      the last window). If you want to check it (if you
      allow the user at all to close the application during modal box or such)
      you can do:

      @longCode(#
        while not SomethingHappened do
          if not Application.ProcessMessage(...) then
            Break;
      #)

      Do not assume too much about message processing internals.
      For example, not all ProcessMessage calls cause redraw, even if redraw
      is requested by Invalidate. When we have messages to process,
      we generally don't call redraw or even OnUpdate.

      @param(WaitForMessage If @true (and some other conditions are met,
        for example we do not have to call OnUpdate continuosly)
        then we can block, waiting for an event to process.

        Set this to @true whenever you can, that is whenever your program
        only responds to user inputs (as opposed to making some operations,
        like animation or loading or ray-tracing something).
        Generally, when @code(SomethingHappened) from the example pseudo-code
        above can only be changed by user events (e.g. user has to click
        something; nothing happens if user doesn't click for 5 minutes or 5 hours).
        This allows to let OS and CPU have some rest, and spend time
        on other applications, or just sleep and conserve laptop battery power.
      )

      @param(WaitToLimitFPS If @true, then we have backup mechanism for
        limiting CPU usage. When WaitForMessage mechanism cannot be used
        (becasue WaitForMessage is @false or some other conditions disallow it),
        and user doesn't throw events at us (we don't want to sleep when user
        produces many events e.g. by mouse move),
        then we can do a small sleep to stabilize number of ProcessMessage
        calls at LimitFPS per second.

        Set this to @true whenever you can, that is whenever you don't need
        ProcessMessage to return as fast as it can. For example,
        when you're displaying some animation, then displaying LimitFPS frames
        should be enough. OTOH, if you really do something that should be done
        as fast as possible (like loading some file or ray-tracing) you probably
        have to set this to @false.
      )
    }
    function ProcessMessage(WaitForMessage, WaitToLimitFPS: boolean): boolean;

    { Processes @italic(all) pending messages. Do not wait for anything.

      Contrast this with ProcessMessage method, that processes only a single
      event. Or no event at all (when no events were pending and
      AllowSuspend = @false). This means that after calling ProcessMessage
      once, you may have many messages left in the queue (especially
      mouse move together with key presses typically makes a lot of
      events). So it's not good to use if you want to react timely to
      some user requests, e.g. when you do something time-consuming
      and allow user to break the task with Escape key.

      ProcessAllMessages is like
      calling in a loop ProcessMessage(false, false), ends when
      ProcessMessage(false, false) didn't process any message
      or when quit was called (or last window closed).

      So ProcessAllMessages makes sure we have processed all pending events,
      thus we are up-to-date with window system requests. }

      TCastleWindow.Open on any window...) this may also happen if you called
      Close (or Application.Quit) from your window OnOpen / OnResize callback.
      In such case no event would probably reach

  { When setting FWidth/FHeight (which is used to report size to user,
    and to create OpenGL area size) we make sure some constaints are honored:

    - You should not be able to resize the window when ResizeAllowed <> raAllowed.
      When ResizeAllowed = raNotAllowed, we want to guarantee that
      FWidth and FHeight stay constant, just as developer set them.

      And some backends do not allow to express,
      or do not reliably honour, all possible ResizeAllowed values.
      E.g. Windows will always resize the window to fit on desktop.
      Window Manager on X can also do this.
      So we need to "forcefully" apply the ResizeAllowed logic here:

      * raNotAllowed: FWidth and FHeight cannot change

      * raOnlyAtOpen: FWidth and FHeight can change only at first EventResize
        (with FirstResizeAfterOpen = true), at least from the point of view of outside.
        Internally, every call to DoResize upto and including FirstResizeAfterOpen call
        changes FWidth and FHeight. This allows to accumulate e.g. size changes
        caused by FullScreen=true, in case OpenBackend does them by explicitly
        calling DoResize, like unix/castlewindow_xlib.inc .

      * raAllowed: FWidth and FHeight can change freely

    - Same thing for Min/MaxWidth/Height.

      BTW, always MinWidth > 0 and MinHeight > 0,
      so the Clamp below will also make sure FWidth and FHeight are > 0.

    We also secure from calls with FirstResizeAfterOpen=false
    from OpenBackend, which may happen from e.g. WinAPI and GTK backends.

    { Keep this check inside fmRenderSwapFlush measurement.

      Naive explanation (seems wrong, see below):
      On Windows, SwapBuffers may execute immediately,
      but then the next OpenGL call actually waits for it to finish
      (see https://www.freelists.org/post/visionegg/swap-buffers-returns-immediately-for-2D-Textures-in-OpenGL-20,1 ).
      So if this is outside fmRenderSwapFlush, fmRenderSwapFlush would be usually
      zero, and most of the frame time would not be covered by anything we measure
      in FrameProfiler.

      The above explanation is however proven wrong by:

      in -dRELEASE builds, without CheckGLErrors call at all,
      fmRenderSwapFlush times are OK, nicely non-zero reasonable.
      I.e. we don't have the problem of fmRenderSwapFlush = zero in -dRELEASE
      builds, and we should -> if the above explanation was all that happens.
      If the above explanation was right, then we should also measure
      the next GL command (like RenderContext.Clear at the start
      of TCastleContainer.EventRender), but we don't need to.

  { This implementation guarantees that

    A. we call some menu item
    B. *or* we call Container.EventPress.

    There is *no* situation possible in which we don't handle key
    (because it matches menu item) but we also don't pass it to DoMenuClick.
    This also avoids some inconsistencies between SeekMatchingMenuItem
    and what GUI toolkit actually does, in case RedirectKeyDownToMenuClick = false
    (like on GTK): e.g. we had situation when SeekMatchingMenuItem was finding a menu
    item (for Key=keyNumPad7, KeyString='7') but for GTK it didn't match corresponding
    menu item.

    It also means it is undefined (backend-specific) whether Container.EventPress
    *does* receive keys that triggered some menu items,
    when RedirectKeyDownToMenuClick = false.
    Some backends may hide such keys, some don't, and in case of
    RedirectKeyDownToMenuClick = false we dont' control it at all.

    Only when RedirectKeyDownToMenuClick = true we guarantee that only *one*
    of A or B fires.

    So:
    - We always guarantee that A or B occurs.
    - Only when RedirectKeyDownToMenuClick = true we guarantee that exactly one
      of A or B occurs.

       that generates a lot of events (like moving the mouse)
       would make us generate a lot OnUpdate events,
       without many OnRender between. Which isn't actually prohibited...
       but it seems useless.

     - Calling OnUpdate later, only if "not WasAnyRendering", would
       also be bad, because then intensive redrawing (e.g. if you redraw
       every frame, with AutoRedisplay) would make OnUpdate called less
       often.

     In effect, we like to have OnUpdate called roughly as often as OnRender,
     even if we don't really guarantee it. }
