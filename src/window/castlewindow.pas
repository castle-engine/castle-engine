{ Window with OpenGL context suitable for 2D and 3D rendering
  of "Castle Game Engine". Provides a window with OpenGL context
  that can contain 2D controls and 3D objects defined by our engine.
  TCastleWindowCustom is the base window class, and TCastleWindow
  is a comfortable class that adds a ready scene manager.

  @link(Application) object (instance of class @link(TCastleApplication))
  is a central manager of all open @link(TCastleWindowCustom) windows.

  Using this unit:

  @orderedList(
    @item(Declare and create @link(TCastleWindowCustom) instance. (Or a descendant
      like @link(TCastleWindow).))

    @item(Assign Window properties and callbacks like
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.OnRender OnRender),
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.OnResize OnResize),
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.Width Width),
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.Height Height),
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.Caption Caption).)

    @item(To initialize your game, you usually want to use
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize).

      If you only care about
      standalone programs (for normal OSes like Linux, Windows, MacOSX,
      but not Android) you may also just initialize your game in the main
      program block, although using
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize)
      is still often comfortable.)

    @item(Call @link(TCastleWindowCustom.Open Window.Open),
      this will actually show the window and it's
      associated OpenGL context.

      The first window open calls
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize).
      It also calls
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.OnOpen OnOpen) and
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.OnResize OnResize) callbacks.)

    @item(Call @link(TCastleApplication.Run Application.Run).
      This will enter message loop that will call
      appropriate windows' callbacks at appropriate times
      (OnRender, OnPress, OnRelease, OnResize, OnUpdate and many more).
      There are also some Application callbacks, like
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnUpdate Application.OnUpdate).

      For more advanced needs you can use something like
        @longCode(#  while Application.ProcessMessage do <something>;#)
      instead of Application.Run.

      You can also call @link(TCastleWindowCustom.OpenAndRun Window.OpenAndRun),
      this is just a shortcut for Window.Open + Application.Run.)

    @item(Application.Run ends when you call @link(TCastleApplication.Quit Application.Quit)
      or when you close last visible window using @link(TCastleWindowCustom.Close Close(true)).

      User is also allowed to close a window using WindowManager facilities
      (clicking on "X" button in the frame corner, pressing Alt+F4 or something
      like that). By default, such user action will make window close
      (but you can freely customize what your program does when user
      tries to close the window using callback
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.OnCloseQuery OnCloseQuery)).)
  )

  So the simplest example of using this unit can look like this:

@longcode(#
  uses CastleWindow;

  var
    Window: TCastleWindowCustom;

  procedure Render(Sender: TUIContainer);
  begin  ...  end;

  procedure Resize(Sender: TUIContainer);
  begin  ...  end;

  begin
    Window := TCastleWindowCustom.Create(Application);
    Window.OnResize := @Resize;
    Window.OnRender := @Render;
    Window.Caption := 'Simplest CastleWindow example';
    Window.OpenAndRun;
  end.
#)

  @italic(More component-like approach):
  For larger programs, it makes more sense to divide functionality into
  controls, which are classes descending from TUIControl.
  You can override TUIControl methods to render, capture input and so on
  (see e.g. @link(TUIControl.Render), @link(TInputListener.Press), @link(TInputListener.Update).)
  You can then add your control to the TCastleWindowCustom.Controls list.

  Some features list:

  @unorderedList(

    @item(TCastleApplication.ProcessMessage method.
      This allows you to reimplement
      event loop handling, which is crucial for implementing things
      like @link(MessageInputQuery) function that does modal GUI dialog box.)

    @item(TCastleWindowCustom.Pressed to easily and reliably check which keys
      are pressed.)

    @item(Frames per second measuring, see @link(TCastleWindowCustom.Fps),)

    @item(A menu bar under WinAPI and GTK backends.

      You can attach a menu to a window. Menu structure is constructed using
      various descendants of TMenuEntry class.
      Then you have to assign such menu structure
      to TCastleWindowCustom.MainMenu property. When CastleWindow is implemented on top
      of GTK_2 or WINAPI or LCL we will show this menu and call
      TCastleWindowCustom.OnMenuClick when user clicks some menu item.
      Other backends (XLIB for now) ignore MainMenu.

      See @code(castle_game_engine/examples/window/window_menu.lpr)
      for an example how to use the menu.)

    @item(Changing screen resolution and bit depth,
      see TCastleApplication.VideoChange.)

    @item(You can request OpenGL context properties:
      @unorderedList(
        @item color buffer
        @item with alpha channel (@link(TCastleWindowCustom.AlphaBits AlphaBits)),
        @item stencil buffer (@link(TCastleWindowCustom.StencilBits StencilBits)),
        @item double buffer (@link(TCastleWindowCustom.DoubleBuffer DoubleBuffer)),
        @item(multisampling (full-screen antialiasing) buffers (by
          @link(TCastleWindowCustom.MultiSampling MultiSampling) or higher-level
          @link(TCastleWindowCustom.AntiAliasing AntiAliasing)))
      )
    )

    @item(You can use native modal dialogs for things such as file selection.
      GTK backend will use GTK dialogs, WinAPI backend
      will use Windows dialog boxes, XLib backend will fall back
      on CastleMessages text input.

      See TCastleWindowCustom.FileDialog (for opening and saving files) and
      TCastleWindowCustom.ColorDialog (for choosing RGB colors).)

    @item(TCastleWindowCustom.ParseParameters method allows you to easily initialize TCastleWindowCustom
      properties like initial size and position using command-line
      parameters like @code(@--geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT), @code(@--display) etc.)
  )
}

{ Choose CastleWindow backend ------------------------------------------ }

{ You can define one of the symbols CASTLE_WINDOW_xxx mentioned below to include
  a specific CastleWindow backend. If you don't, there is a code lower that
  chooses the best backend for given OS.

  Available backends:

  CASTLE_WINDOW_GTK_2
    Based on GTK 2.x, using GtkGLExt extension. Made 2005-02.
    MainMenu is implemented as a nice-looking GTK menu bar.
    Dialog windows implemented using GTK dialog windows.
    Generally, has a nice native look of GTK application.

    Should work under any OS where GTK works.
    Currently tested under Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Windows.

    FullScreen is cleanly implemented in GTK_2, never using override_redirect,
    so Alt+Tab always works (even when your window is fullscreen),
    and things like gnome-panel will never cover your fullscreen window.
    Also changing FullScreen is nice, GTK will instruct the window manager
    to fullscreen/unfullscreen the window, which means it will happen
    without recreating the OpenGL context.

    Known problems:
    - Tab key cannot work as menu item shortcut (it's always only
      for switching focus). This is an issue with GTK 1/2,
      that simply can't be fixed in CastleWindow.
    - TryVideoChange is not finished, i.e. always returns false.
      See TODOs near CASTLE_WINDOW_USE_XF86VMODE definition.
    - Under Windows, window will be always resizeable by user, even if
      you set ResizeAllowed <> raAllowed.
      This is masked in our unit (so your OnResize callback will not get
      to know such thing), so it's harmless for correctness of your programs,
      but user can do it.

    Historically, we also had CASTLE_WINDOW_GTK_1, based on GTK 1.x (>= 1.2)
    using GtkGLArea widget. Was made around beginning of march 2004.
    Removed 2011-12 (commit r10674), ancient and obsoleted by GTK 2.

  CASTLE_WINDOW_WINAPI
    Based on Windows API. Of course only for Windows.

    MainMenu is implemented as WinAPI menu bar. So it looks nice.
    Dialog windows are implemented as common Windows dialog boxes.
    Has a nice native look on Windows.

  CASTLE_WINDOW_XLIB
    Based on XLib units. No X toolkit is used.
    Only for OSes where X is used, which in practice means Unix.

    For desktop OpenGL (when OpenGLES is not defined) this is implemented
    on top of glX.
    For OpenGL ES (when OpenGLES is defined) this is implemented
    on top of EGL, Embedded-System Graphics Library.
    This is the only backend capable of initializing OpenGL ES contexts
    for now.

    MainMenu is not implemented (it's ignored).
    That's not easy to implement when you don't want to use any X toolkit.
    And it's not a good idea to implement it yourself (without any standard
    GUI toolkit) --- this makes many Xlib programs ugly, because every single one
    uses his own GUI. In other words:
    if you want to have MainMenu then just use CASTLE_WINDOW_GTK_2.

    Dialog boxes are implemented using CastleMessages.MessageXxx.
    So they are not very comfortable to user, but they work.

    On Unix platforms, whether you should use CASTLE_WINDOW_GTK_2 or
    this CASTLE_WINDOW_XLIB depends on your program.

    - For utility programs, usually CASTLE_WINDOW_GTK_2.
      You want the menu bar and native (GTK-themed) look of dialog boxes.

    - For fullscreen games, usually CASTLE_WINDOW_XLIB.
      You usually do not use the menu bar in fullscreen games,
      and do not want popup dialog boxes. Instead you draw everything
      inside your OpenGL context, which makes your game look the same
      regardless of the platform and GUI can be styled to your game theme.
      For example, menu may be done by TCastleOnScreenMenu, and dialog boxes
      by CastleMessages.

      As a bonus, XLIB allows you to change screen resolution when
      starting the game, which may be useful. And has one dependency less
      (GTK is commonly installed, but gtkglext is not, and CASTLE_WINDOW_GTK_2
      requires gtkglext).

  CASTLE_WINDOW_LCL
    Use Lazarus TForm (with menu, dialogs and so on) and TOpenGLControl.
    This wraps Lazarus form and TOpenGLControl inside a TCastleWindowCustom
    instance.
    It's cross-platform, it has a native look --- all thanks to Lazarus LCL.
    It misses some things that Lazarus misses ---- like screen resizing,
    and event loop may have problems in case of mouse look.

    To use this:
    - You have to add castle_components package
      to the requirements of the castle_window Lazarus package.

      It will also automatically add LazOpenGLContext package as dependency
      of castle_window, which is good.
      We need castle_components package for LCL helpers
      (like converting mouse/keys between LCL and CastleKeysMouse),
      and we need LazOpenGLContext package for TOpenGLControl.
      Note that we do *not* use TCastleControl component in this case.

      This is a necessary manual step, as Lazarus packages do not have (yet)
      any mechanism to express a package dependency that is OS-specific.

    - And usually you should compile programs only using Lazarus
      (IDE or lazbuild), to automatically have correct LCL paths used.

  CASTLE_WINDOW_ANDROID
    Initialize OpenGL context using EGL on Android.

  CASTLE_WINDOW_LIBRARY
    Use existing OpenGL context.
    This is useful when the engine is used as a library (see src/library/),
    and an external code already initialized OpenGL context.

    Note that the external code must take care to initialize
    context following our TCastleWindow properties like
    TCastleWindow.DepthBits, TCastleWindow.StencilBits and such.
    It also must take care of calling TCastleWindowCustom.LibraryXxx
    methods to notify us about events like key/mouse press.

  CASTLE_WINDOW_TEMPLATE
    This is a special dummy backend, useful only as an example
    for programmers that want to implement another CastleWindow backend
    (e.g. based on Mac OS X Carbon).
    It compiles, but actually nothing works.
    See file CASTLE_WINDOW_backend_template.inc.
}

{ Define CASTLE_WINDOW_BEST_NOGUI to choose the best backend for programs
  that do not use native gui (like native dialog boxes in TCastleWindow.MessageOK
  or native menu bar in TCastleWindow.Menu). On Unix, this will choose Xlib,
  that allows you to resize the screen and has less dependencies than GtkGlExt
  backend. }

{ To make new GL Window backend -------------------------------------

  - Define a symbol like CASTLE_WINDOW_FOO for a new backend,
    document it in the "available backends list" above.
  - Create a file castlewindow_foo.inc with contents from
    castlewindow_backend_template.inc
    and conditionally include it from castlewindow_backend.inc.
  - Adjust defining
    CASTLE_WINDOW_HAS_VIDEO_CHANGE and CASTLE_WINDOW_USE_PRIVATE_MODIFIERS_DOWN
    for your backend.
  - Implement all methods in castlewindow_foo.inc. You wil find the specification
    what each method should do in the specification of the interface of this
    module.
  - Call all TCastleWindowCustom.DoXxx functions at appropriate places from your
    backend.
    You can call all DoUpdate and DoTimer for all Application.OpenWindows
    using Application.FOpenWindows.DoUpdate/Timer (this will give usually
    inefficient but working backend)
  - Call TCastleApplication.DoApplicationUpdate and DoApplicationTimer when appropriate.
    Remember that you can always assume that the ONLY existing instance of
    TCastleApplication is Application.
  Some important things that can be easily forgotten:
  - Remember that probably you will have to call ReleaseAllKeysAndMouse
    when user switches to another window or activates MainMenu.
}

{ Configure some debugging options of CastleWindow ------------------------------- }

{ Define CASTLE_WINDOW_CHECK_GL_ERRORS_AFTER_DRAW to check OpenGL errors
  after TCastleWindowCustom.EventRender (TCastleWindowCustom.OnRender callback) calls.
  This is done by DoRender, that is: when a backend initiates the drawing.
  The check is done by CastleGLUtils.CheckGLErrors, checks glGetError
  and eventually raises an exception. }
{$ifdef DEBUG}
  {$define CASTLE_WINDOW_CHECK_GL_ERRORS_AFTER_DRAW}
{$endif}

{ Configure internal things -------------------------------------------------- }

{$ifdef CASTLE_WINDOW_GTK_2} {$define CASTLE_WINDOW_GTK_ANY} {$endif}

{ Sometimes GTK backend needs to call some X-specific things:
  1. Implementing TCastleWindowCustom.SetMousePosition.
     Older GDK/GTK versions didn't have any function for this (see here
     [http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2001-January/msg00035.html]),
     although newer GDK has gdk_display_warp_pointer.
     So we had to bypass GTK and use Xlib's XWarpPointer.
  2. Screen resizing. We have to use for this XF86VidMode extension,
     just like for CASTLE_WINDOW_XLIB backend. }

{ TODO:

  General:
  - TCastleWindowCustom.Width, Height, Left, Top: allow to change them
    after the window is opened.
  - Use EnumDisplaySettings instead of such variables as
    VideoColorBits / VideoScreenWidth / VideoFrequency,
    do some proc DisplayExists and EnumDisplays.
  - Allow passing VideoColorBits, VideoFrequency for --fullscreen-custom
    param.

      Here's a list of properties that should be made "visible" to the user
      in OpenBackend:

        Width, Height, Left, Top
        Cursor, CustomCursor, FullScreen (remember that changes to this after OpenBackend
          should also be allowed)
        ResizeAllowed (DoResize already implements appropriate
          checks, but implementation should provide user with visual clues that
          the window may / may not be resized)
        MainMenu (display MainMenu and provide way to call DoMenuClick)

      OpenGL context must be initialized honouring these properties:
        DoubleBuffer, StencilBits, DepthBits, AlphaBits,
        AccumBits, MultiSampling }
    procedure OpenBackend;

    { Close OpenGL context, for particular backend.

      No need to call OpenWindowsRemove here, it's done by universal Close already.
      It's advised (although not totally required) that all errors during
      CloseBackend should be caught and cause only OnWarning.
      Reasoning: Close should, regardless of trouble, try to finalize as much
      as possible. }
    procedure CloseBackend;

    { Make the OpenGL context of this window current (active for following
      OpenGL commands). }
    procedure BackendMakeCurrent;

    { Swap OpenGL buffers.
      Call this method only when DoubleBuffered and if you already did
      MakeCurrent. (Implicit glFlush is guaranteed.) }
    procedure SwapBuffers;

    { BackendMenuInitialize should cause backend to build whole menu resources
      for MainMenu, BackendMenuFinalize to free them.

      BackendMenuFinalize is called before changing MainMenu structure
      in arbitrary way, BackendMenuInitialize is called after.
      Backend should just free / initialize resources related to menu.
      BackendMenuInitialize may assume that BackendMenuFinalize was already called
      (so no need to try to free in BackendMenuInitialize again).

      They are never called directly: always call MenuInitialize / Finalize.
      These make sure to care about eventual MenuUpdateBegin / MenuUpdateEnd
      around, and make sure BackendMenuFinalize is called only when menu is
      already initialized (by BackendMenuInitialize), and
      BackendMenuInitialize is called only when menu is not initialized yet.

      Implementation of these can assume that MainMenu <> nil now,
      and that MainMenuVisible = @true.
      Also it may assume that Closed = false.

      Note: if backend wants, it may itself call these from
      OpenBackend / CloseBackend. Of course, when you call them
      yourself, you have to make sure on your own that all assumptions
      are satisfied. In practice, BackendMenuFinalize should clear all the variables
      to the state right after constructor (zero, nil etc.),
      and BackendMenuInitialize expect them as such, and then everything will work Ok.

      @groupBegin }
    procedure BackendMenuInitialize;
    procedure BackendMenuFinalize;
    { @groupEnd }

    { These call corresponding BackendMenuInitialize or BackendMenuFinalize,
      unless we're inside MenuUpdateBegin / MenuUpdateEnd,
      and take care to only initialize when finalized,
      and finalize only when initialized.
      They also take care of checking Closed and MainMenuVisible properties.
      @groupBegin }
    procedure MenuInitialize;
    procedure MenuFinalize;

    { Notification called immediately after menu entry properties changed.
      This is called only when MainMenu <> nil and Entry is contained
      inside our MainMenu. Also, this is called only when not Closed.

      In case of MenuUpdateXxx calls: You can be sure that
      only appropriate local Entry properties changed, no other menu entry
      (even child menu entry for submenus) was changed.

      Sloppy backend may simply do here MenuFinalize + MenuInitialize,
      but a better backend may do something more efficient,
      like updating only this specific Entry resources.

      In case of MenuInsert: remember that this is called
      after Entry was added to Parent. So if your MenuInsert simply
      calls MenuFinalize + MenuInitialize, make sure your MenuFinalize
      handles the case that some TMenuEntry may have uninitialized (zero)
      TMenuEntry.Handle.

      In case of MenuDelete: remember that this is called
      after Entry was removed from Parent. So if your MenuDelete simply
      calls MenuFinalize + MenuInitialize, make sure your MenuFinalize
      finalizes (releases backend-specific resources) also for Entry
      that isn't in the MainMenu hierarchy anymore.

      Both MenuInsert and MenuDelete problems disappear if your
      MenuFinalize doesn't look at MainMenu.Entries hierarchy, and releases
      in one go whole backend-specific hierarchy under MainMenu.Handle.
      Or if you implement MenuInsert and MenuDelete in a more optimal way,
      without MenuFinalize + MenuInitialize.

      (e.g. when he opens our MainMenu), such that we are then unable to catch

      all keys and mouse buttons.

    { Should DoKeyDown be able to call DoMenuClick, that is should
      we handle menu key shortcuts ourselves.

      This is implemented in backend-specific CastleWindow parts.
      When in DoKeyDown we get some key event that specifies that
      some menu item should be called -- if RedirectKeyDownToMenuClick,
      DoKeyDown will do DoMenuClick. Else DoKeyDown will do nothing.

      This should be implemened as "Result := true" if we have to process
      keypresses in CastleWindow to pass them as menu commands, e.g. when CastleWindow
      works on top of Xlib.
      When CastleWindow works on top of GTK or WinAPI that allow us to do a "real"
      menu, this should be implemented as "Result := false". }
    function RedirectKeyDownToMenuClick: boolean;

    { DoXxx methods ------------------------------------------------------------

      DoXxx method should be called by CastleWindow backend when an event
      Xxx happens. DoXxx methods take care of various backend-independent
      stuff, and take care of calling EventXxx (that calls OnXxx in turn).
      CastleWindow backend should never call EventXxx directly.
      (And nothing should call OnXxx directly except EventXxx.)

      Remember that no DoXxx may be called from CloseBackend.

      Below is the detailed specification, but summing some things up
      you don't have to worry about these things when you use DoXxx methods
      (these things are fully handled by DoXxx methods):
      - updating state of MousePressed
      - updating state of Pressed (Pressed.Keys, Pressed.Characters etc.)
      - updating state of MousePosition
      - calling MakeCurrent before every EventXxx
      - flushing gl commands (and swapping gl buffers when DoubleBuffer'ing)
      - taking care of AutoRedisplay
      - updating Width, Height (and updating it with accordance to
        Min/MaxWidth/Height and ResizeAllowed)
      - checking MainMenu.Enabled
    }

  public
    { DoResize with FirstResizeAfterOpen = true is called only once
      (and exactly once) from TCastleWindowCustom.Open implementation.
      So all CastleWindow-backend code should always
      pass FirstResizeAfterOpen = false (EVEN if it may be called from
      OpenBackend (that is called before DoResize in Open) !).

      Some more notes about calling DoResize from OpenBackend:
      in this case DoResize will NOT call EventResize (since the first callback
      that should be called for a window is EventOpen). We will always after
      EventOpen call DoResize(..., true), so this should not be a problem
      anywhere. You can simply call DoResize from OpenBackend to tell us what
      real Width/Height we have, and the real EventResize will be called
      just at a later time.

      You can pass here ANY AWidth, AHeight. It will be automatically clipped
      here to fit in Min/MaxWidth/Height and to satisfy ResizeAllowed.

      Also MakeCurrent + EventResize will be called (probably; sometimes
      DoResize may decide to not call EventResize - e.g. when ResizeAllowed
      =raNotAllowed and FirstTime = false then it's useless to call here
      EventResize).

      Remember: this function does not automatically call Invalidate.
      You must make sure that soon after changing size of the window
      you will call DoRender (e.g. you can call Invalidate after
      calling DoResize; but usually (under WinAPI, Xlib, GTK)
      it's not needed, i.e. WinAPI, Xlib, and GTK all take care of this
      automatically). }
    procedure DoResize(AWidth, AHeight: integer; FirstResizeAfterOpen: boolean);

      - Take care of AutoRedisplay, like

          @code(if AutoRedisplay then Invalidate;)

        So specific CastleWindow backends need not to worry about
        AutoRedisplay. They only have to call this when Invalidated = @true. }

    { DoKeyDown/Up: pass here key that is pressed down or released up.

      Only DoKeyDown: pass also CharKey. Pass Key = K_None if this is not

      (this would have no meaning).

      Only DoKeyUp: never pass Key = K_None.

         update Pressed (Pressed.Keys, Pressed.Characters, etc.) accordingly,

      Allowing this is a good thing, as it means our process doesn't eat
      your CPU when it simply waits, doing nothing, for user input.
      On the other hand, you cannot allow this if you want to do some
      things continously, regardless of user input.

    { Size of the window OpenGL area. Together with frame and border
      sizes, and eventually menu bar size, this determines the final
      window size.

      When the window is open, these are read-only (may only change
      through internal methods, that is: we'll update @link(Width), @link(Height),
      @link(Left), @link(Top) to reflect current size and position).

      MinWidth / MaxWidth / MinHeight / MaxHeight place constraints
      on these values (rigorously honored when window is open):
      always @code(MinWidth <= Width <= MaxWidth) and
      @code(MinHeight <= Height <= MaxHeight).

      ResizeAllowed places constrains when window manager and user may change
      window size. In particular, when ResizeAllowed <> raAllowed then
      window sizes cannot change when window is open.

      Note that for some window managers, we cannot always reliably
      force the size constraints and block resizing on the desktop.
      If you set rigorous size constraints, or ResizeAllowed <> raAllowed,
      you may find that window manager still resizes the window.
      In such cases, we may fake our size a little ---
      @link(Width) and @link(Height) values may not correspond to actual
      size as seen on the desktop. This is comfortable, as in such cases
      you usually want to just ignore window managers limits and just
      proceed as if your size requirements are satisfied.

      Special WindowDefaultSize value of these properties
      means: at @link(Open), calculate and use some comfortable window size.

      to fill the whole screen.

      Application.ScreenWidth and Application.ScreenHeight), ignoring
      the window size constraints like MinWidth, MaxWidth, MinHeight, MaxHeight
      and ResizeAllowed. For example we do not check does Application.ScreenWidth
      fit inside MinWidth and MaxWidth. It's assumed that you really want
      to set/unset the fullscreen UI if you change this property.
      However, the sizes known to your application (stored in @link(Width), @link(Height))
      are still constrained by MinWidth, MaxWidth, MinHeight, MaxHeight
      and ResizeAllowed.

      You can change this always, even on already open window.
      Just note that some backends don't allow to switch this without
      destroying / recreating the OpenGL context. So be prepared that changing FullScreen
      may result in OnClose + OnOpen sequence, so make sure that closing and opening
      recreates the whole necessary OpenGL state exactly as it was. This is usually

      Or you can use ColorBits that reads / writes all three channels bits.
      Reading ColorBits simply returns the sum of
      @code(RedBits + GreenBits + BlueBits).
      Writing ColorBits simply set RedBits and BlueBits to
      @code(ColorBits div 3), and sets GreenBits to the remainder.
      This way green channel has always the best resolution (as is usual,
      since it's perceived most), and the sum is always as requested.
      This way setting ColorBits to values like 16 or 24 works as expected.

      Note that it's also possible to change color resolution by
      changing the whole screen settings.
      See TCastleApplication.VideoColorBits and TCastleApplication.VideoChange for this.
      These properties only request the color
      resolution for this window, which is less intrusive (you don't change
      the whole screen) but also may have a smaller chance of success.

          if you don't want to. However, @link(Width) / @link(Height)
          values will be kept unchanged (they will not be updated to Application.ScreenWidth

          may decide that the size is too large for the current screen.

          adjusted to match current screen size. Also they will always be

    { OpenGL context is created, initialize things that require OpenGL
      context. Often you do not need to use this callback (engine components will
      automatically create/release OpenGL resource when necessary),
      but sometimes it may be handy (e.g. TGLImage required OpenGL context).
      You usually will also want to implement Window.OnClose callback that
      releases stuff created here.

      Instead of using this callback, even when you really need to initialize
      some OpenGL resource, it's usually better to derive new classes from
      TUIControl class or it's descendants,
      and override their GLContextOpen / GLContextClose methods to react to
      context being open/closed. Using such TUIControl classes
      is usually easier, as you add/remove them from controls whenever
      you want (e.g. you add them in
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize)),
      and underneath they create/release/create again the OpenGL resources
      when necessary.

      OnOpen is always called @bold(after)
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize).
      In normal circumstances, for a typical standalone game, the OnOpen will
      happen only once. But for other targets, it may be necessary to close/reopen
      the OpenGL context many times, e.g. on mobile platforms it's normal
      that application may "loose" the OpenGL context and it may need
      to recreate OpenGL resources when it wakes up.
      Event called when OpenGL context is initialized.

      It's guaranteed that every newly opened window will get
      EventOpen (OnOpen) first, and then EventResize (OnResize),
      and only then --- the other callbacks, as the user uses the window.
      This is consistent EventOpen (OnOpen)
      is always the first executed callback and OnClose
      is always the last. This allows you to cleanly initialize / finalize
      OpenGL resources.

      During EventOpen (OnOpen) you already have valid
      Width / Height values, that is those values were already adjusted
      if ResizeAllowed <> raNotAllowed.

      @bold(Be careful what you do in this callback if you want your game
      to work on Android or other non-standalone platforms.)
      On Android, OpenGL context may be closed and opened at any time,
      as user can switch from/to your application at any time.
      You should use
      @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize Application.OnInitialize)
      for a one-time initialization (it is executed right before
      the very first OnOpen would be executed).
      Use this callback only to create OpenGL resources

          If you're writing 3d program and sitting on some

      Of course, if you are writing a program that does not need depth buffer

      default DepthBits = 16 is that if you forget to set
      Window.DepthBits := 0 your programs will still work (most graphic cards

    (*Should this window be actually displayed on the desktop.
      In all normal programs you want to leave this as @true, as the

      on the desktop.

      Setting this to @false allows you to get an OpenGL context without
      showing anything on the desktop. This can be used for rendering

      One example is the @--screenshot option of view3dscene, see
      [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/view3dscene.php#section_screenshot].

      If you implement such thing, remember that you should not render
      and capture the normal front or back buffer contents.
      OpenGL makes no guarantee that a hidden window will have any allocated
      memory, so capturing hidden window contents isn't useful (you may
      get something valid, or you may get random / blank screen, depending
      on OS and GPU). However, you can create Framebuffer Object
      on modern GPUs, and capture it's contents. An example code snippet:

      It's called right after @code(Pressed[Key]) changed from true to false.

      The TInputPressRelease structure, passed as a parameter to this event,
      contains the exact information what was released.

      Note that reporting characters for "key release" messages is not
      perfect, as various key combinations (sometimes more than one?) may lead
      to generating given character. We have some intelligent algorithm
      for this, used to make Characters table and to detect
      this C for OnRelease callback. The idea is that a character is released
      when the key that initially caused the press of this character is
      also released.

      This solves in a determined way problems like
      "what happens if I press Shift, then X,
      then release Shift, then release X". (will "X" be correctly
      released as pressed and then released? yes.
      will small "x" be reported as released at the end? no, as it was never
      pressed.) }

    { Called when user tries to close the window.
      This is called when you use window manager features to close the window,

      on most desktops. This is @italic(not) called when you explicitly
      close the window by calling the @link(Close) method.

      When this callback is not assigned, we will
      just let the window be closed. When it's assigned,
      the window will not closed --- you should call here @link(Close)
      explicitly if you want to (for example, after asking user for
      confirmation "do you really want to quit?").

      When handling this event, you must remember that user
      may try to close our window at any time.
      E.g. if you're implementing here somehing like showing user
      text "You cannot quit now" or asking user "Do you really want to quit"
      remember that while you display such message to user and you're
      processing events (e.g. looking for keypress "Yes" or "No"),
      user may try to close your window again.

      CastleMessages unit offers some nice routines that you can safely
      use here, e.g. you can use it inside OnCloseQuery like

        if MessageYesNo(Window, 'Are you sure you want to quit?') then
         Close;

      Inside MessageYesNo, when we're processing events,
      and waiting for user's answer (yes or no),
      futher OnCloseQuery events will be ignored, so everything will work OK.

      This event is also useful if you want to call Close(false)
      on closing the window (i.e. QuitWhenLastWindowClosed = false).
      By default, if this event is undefined, we call Close(true)
      when user tries to close the window. }

      to this window. For example when you check this window's
      @link(Pressed) keys state, or animate something displayed on this window.

      @link(TCastleApplication.TimerMilisec Application.TimerMilisec).
      We consciously decided to not implement anything more involved here.
      If you need really flexible timer mechanism, do not use this.
      Instead use @link(OnUpdate)
      (or TUIControl.Update, or T3D.Update) and look at it's @code(SecondsPassed)
      value to perform actions (one time or repeated) with a specified delay.
      The engine source is full of examples of this.

      Under Lazarus, you can of course also use LCL timers. }

      If your game may have a still screen (nothing animates),
      then this approach is a little unoptimal, as we use CPU and GPU
      for drawing, when it's not needed. In such case, you can set this
      property to @false, and make sure that you call
      @link(Invalidate) always when you need to redraw the screen.
      Note that the engine components always call @link(Invalidate) when
      necessary, so usually you should only call it yourself if you provide

      You can change this almost freely while not Closed: you can use
      various properties of TMenuEntry descendants (adding, deleting items
      from TMenu, changing Caption, Key, CharKey, Checked properties --
      anything) and you can change value of MainMenu BUT you must not
      change MainMenu <> nil state when the window is not Closed.
      I.e. if you called Open with MainMenu = nil, then MainMenu must stay
      nil unit Close. If you called Open with MainMenu <> nil, then you
      can assign other MainMenu values while not Closed, but only values
      <>nil. I.e. you can't set MainMenu to nil if you called Open
      with MainMenu <> nil.
      See @code(castle_game_engine/examples/window/window_menu.lpr)
      for demo of changing value of MainMenu while window is not Closed.

      Note that MainMenu.Enabled is honoured (as well as Enabled
      for all menu items inside, of course).
      You can use this to disallow user from clicking on the whole
      menu. When MainMenu.Enabled = @false then
      no MenuItem.DoClick, no OnMenuClick

      When user presses some keyboard shortcut for some menu item,

        If it's not possible to obtain

        For example, maybe you set AlphaBits, DepthBits, StencilBits, AccumBits
        properties too high?

        It's guaranteed that when EGLContextNotPossible
        is raised, the window remains in correct (closed) state.
        This means that you can catch EGLContextNotPossible
        and lower some OpenGL buffer requirements and try to open once again.
        Although it's usually more comfortable to use the overloaded
        version of @link(Open) with Retry callback for this purpose.

        This parameterless version of Open automatically
        turns off multi-sampling (AntiAliasing and MultiSampling
        properties), and then we turn off
        stencil buffer (StencilBits), if OpenGL context cannot be initialized.
        But if it still cannot be initialized, we raise EGLContextNotPossible.
        You can use overloaded Open version with Retry callback to customize
        this fallback mechanism, to code which OpenGL context features
        may be turned off.)
    }

    { Open the window with OpenGL context, allowing you to lower
      the OpenGL context requirements and retry.

      If the OpenGL context cannot be initialized,

      @unorderedList(
        @item(lower some context requirements (like set MultiSampling to 1
          if it was > 1) if possible, and return @true to retry, or)

      that turns off AntiAliasing and MultiSampling, and then StencilBits
      (since all our engine code should be ready that multi-sampling
      or stencil buffers may not be available).
      Using your own Retry callback, with this version,
      allows you to decide which context parameters may be lowered
      to allow creating a window.

        requested OpenGL context, and the @code(Retry) callback

        callbacks of Application and callbacks of other TCastleWindowCustom MAY be called while
        the dialog is open. Callbacks of THIS object (OnXxx) will not be

        Under Xlib backend we simply fallback on CastleMessages.Message*.
    }

    { Select a file to open or save.
      Accepts and returns argument as an URL.
      Passing a filename as an URL is also allowed (as everywhere),
      it may be changed into an URL on return.

      This dialog may also allow user for some typical file-management
      operations by the way (create some directories, rename some files etc.).

      Returns @true and sets URL accordingly if user chooses some
      file and accepts it. Returns @false if user cancels.

      @param(Title A dialog title.)

      @param(URL Specifies default file as an URL (or simple filename).

        In short, things are designed such that for normal file viewers,
        you can give here the URL of last opened file, or '' if none.

        This URL can be absolute or relative, may include a path, may include a name.
        If you specify only a path (remember to end it with the slash),
        then it's the default path where to save the file.
        If you specify the name (component after final slash), then it's the
        proposed file name for saving (for OpenDialog, this proposed file name
        is ignored, since that's more natural for open dialogs).

        Empty value ('') always means the same as "current directory", guaranteed.
        So it's equivalent to @code(URICurrentPath).

        Note that the path must end with a slash. Otherwise '/tmp/blah' would be
        ambigous (it could mean either file name 'blah' in the dir '/tmp/' dir,
        or dir '/tmp/blah' without a proposed file name).)

      @param(OpenDialog Is this an open (@true) or save (@false) file dialog.

            about it though (it's not possible to guarantee it on a multi-process OS),
            the only 100% sure way to know that the file can be opened and read
            is to actually try to do it.

            To directly read a file (as a stream) from the obtained URL
            you should usually use our CastleDownload.Download function.
            This way you get a readable stream and you
            automatically support loading data from the other protocols (http,
            data etc.) too.)

          @item(
            If OpenDialog = @false: a save dialog.
            Allows user to select a non-existing file.
            If user chooses an existing file, some backends may show
            a warning like @italic("Are you sure you want to overwrite this file?").

            The intention is that directory of the returned file should exist,
            and you should be able to write files there.
            But, again, there is no 100% guarantee about it.
            The only way to be sure whether you can save a file is to actually
            try to do it.

            To directly write to a file (as a stream) to the obtained URL

      For multi-window apps (games that can be played simultaneously

      can display different models in different windows) you can
      leave MainWindow at @nil and just focus on creating a special

    { Process messages from the window system.
      You have to call this repeatedly to process key presses,
      mouse events, redraws and everything else.
      Messages are processed and appropriate window callbacks are called,
      like TCastleWindowCustom.OnRender,
      TCastleWindowCustom.OnUpdate,
      TCastleWindowCustom.OnKeyPress and many others.

      For simple programs calling the @link(Run) method is usually
      the best solution, @link(Run) just calls ProcessMessage in a loop.
      Manually using the ProcessMessage method allows you to implement
      modal dialog boxes (generally any kind of "display something
      until something happens" behavior). Make your own event loop like this:

@longCode(#
  while not SomethingHappened do
    Application.ProcessMessages(...);
#)

      Often this is used together with TGLMode, TGLModeFrozenScreen
      and similar utilities from CastleWindowModes unit.
      They allow you to temporarily replace window callbacks with new ones,
      and later restore the original ones.
      This is useful for behavior similar to modal dialog boxes.

      For comfort, returns @code(not Terminated).
      So it returns @true if we should continue, that is
      if @code(Terminate) method was not called (directly or by closing
      the last window). If you want to check it (if you
      allow the user at all to close the application during modal box or such)
      you can do:

@longCode(#
  while not SomethingHappened do
    if not Application.ProcessMessage(...) then
      Break;
#)

      Do not assume too much about message processing internals.
      For example, not all ProcessMessage calls cause redraw, even if redraw
      is requested by Invalidate. When we have messages to process,
      we generally don't call redraw or even OnUpdate.

      @param(WaitForMessage If @true (and some other conditions are met,
        for example we do not have to call OnUpdate continuosly)
        then we can block, waiting for an event to process.

        Set this to @true whenever you can, that is whenever your program
        only responds to user inputs (as opposed to making some operations,
        like animation or loading or ray-tracing something).
        Generally, when @code(SomethingHappened) from the example pseudo-code
        above can only be changed by user events (e.g. user has to click
        something; nothing happens if user doesn't click for 5 minutes or 5 hours).
        This allows to let OS and CPU have some rest, and spend time
        on other applications, or just sleep and conserve laptop battery power.
      )

      @param(WaitToLimitFPS If @true, then we have backup mechanism for
        limiting CPU usage. When WaitForMessage mechanism cannot be used
        (becasue WaitForMessage is @false or some other conditions disallow it),
        and user doesn't throw events at us (we don't want to sleep when user
        produces many events e.g. by mouse move),
        then we can do a small sleep to stabilize number of ProcessMessage
        calls at LimitFPS per second.

        Set this to @true whenever you can, that is whenever you don't need
        ProcessMessage to return as fast as it can. For example,
        when you're displaying some animation, then displaying LimitFPS frames
        should be enough. OTOH, if you really do something that should be done
        as fast as possible (like loading some file or ray-tracing) you probably
        have to set this to @false.
      )
    }
    function ProcessMessage(WaitForMessage, WaitToLimitFPS: boolean): boolean;

    { Processes @italic(all) pending messages. Do not wait for anything.

      Contrast this with ProcessMessage method, that processes only a single
      event. Or no event at all (when no events were pending and
      AllowSuspend = @false). This means that after calling ProcessMessage
      once, you may have many messages left in the queue (especially
      mouse move together with key presses typically makes a lot of
      events). So it's not good to use if you want to react timely to
      some user requests, e.g. when you do something time-consuming
      and allow user to break the task with Escape key.

      ProcessAllMessages is like
      calling in a loop ProcessMessage(false, false), ends when
      ProcessMessage(false, false) didn't process any message
      or when quit was called (or last window closed).

      So ProcessAllMessages makes sure we have processed all pending events,
      thus we are up-to-date with window system requests. }

      Note that this does nothing if OpenWindowsCount = 0, that is there
      are no open windows. Besides the obvious reason (you didn't call
      TCastleWindowCustom.Open on any window...) this may also happen if you called
      Close (or Application.Quit) from your window OnOpen / OnResize callback.
      In such case no event would probably reach
      our program, and user would have no chance to quit, so Run just refuses
      to work and exits immediately without any error. }
