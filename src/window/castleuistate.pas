  { UI state, a useful singleton to manage the state of your game UI.

    In simple cases, only one state is @italic(current) at a given time,
    and it can be get or set using the @link(TUIState.Current) property.
    In more complex cases, you can use @link(TUIState.Push) and @link(TUIState.Pop)
    to build a stack of states, and in effect multiple states are active at the same time.
    All of the states on stack are @italic(started), but only the top-most is @italic(resumed).

    Each state has @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
    methods that you can override to perform work when state becomes
    part of the current state stack, or stops being part of it.
    You can also override @link(Resume) and @link(Pause) methods,
    to perform work when the state becomes the top-most state or is no longer
    the top-most state. The distinction becomes important once you play
    around with pushing/popping states.
    The names are deliberaly similar to Android lifecycle callback names.

    You can add/remove state-specific UI controls in various ways.
    You can add them in the constructor of this state (and then free in destructor),
    or add them in @link(Start), free in @link(Stop).

    @orderedList(
      @item(It's simplest and best to add/keep children controls as real
        children of the current state, so add them
        using methods @link(TUIControl.InsertFront) and
        @link(TUIControl.InsertBack).)

      @item(Eventually, for special tricks, you can add controls that are
        conceptually the state "children" directly to the
        @code(StateContainer.Controls) list.
        This allows to keep some children on the @code(StateContainer.Controls)
        list for a longer
        time (not only when this state is active), which may be useful for optimization,
        to not reinitialize GL resources too often.
        To do this, add controls using
        @code(StateContainer.Controls.InsertFront(...)), remove them by
        @code(StateContainer.Controls.Remove(...)),
        and make sure to override @link(InsertAtPosition) method such that state instance
        is inserted in @code(StateContainer.Controls) right behind your UI.)
    )

    Current state is also placed on the list of container controls.
    This way state is notified
    about UI events, and can react to them. Since state-specific UI
    should always be at the front of us, or our children,
    so in case of events that can be "handled"
    (like TUIControl.Press, TUIControl.Release events)
    the state-specific UI controls will handle them @italic(before)
    the state itself (if you override TUIControl.Press or such in state,
    be sure to call @code(inherited) first, to make sure it really
    happens).

    This way state can

    @unorderedList(
      @item(catch press/release and similar events, when no other
        state-specific control handled them,)
      @item(catch update, GL context open/close and other useful events,)
      @item(can have it's own render function, to directly draw UI.)
    )

    See the TUIControl class for a lot of useful methods that you can
    override in your state descendants to capture various events. }

    { State becomes active, it's now part of the state stack.

      Started state is part of the StateStack, and will soon become
      running (top-most on the stack). When the state is set to be current,
      by @code(TUIState.Current := MyState), this happens:

      @orderedList(
        @item(MyStart is pushed as the top-most state on state stack.)
        @item(MyStart.Start is called.)
        @item(MyStart is added to the @code(StateContainer.Controls) list,
          so the state methods GLContextOpen and Resize are called
          (as for all normal TUIControl instances).)
        @item(MyStar.Resume is called.)
      ) }
    procedure Start; virtual;

    { State is no longer active, no longer part of state stack.

      When the state stops becoming active, this happens:

      @orderedList(
        @item(MyStart.Pause is called.)
        @item(MyStart is removed from the
          @code(StateContainer.Controls) list.
          So the state method GLContextClose is called
          (as for all normal TUIControl instances).)
        @item(MyStart.Stop is called.)
        @item(MyStart is removed from the on state stack.)
      )

      This is always called to finalize the started state.
      When the state is destroyed, it's @link(Pause) and @link(Stop)
      are called too, so you can use this method to reliably finalize whatever
      you initialized in @link(Start). }
    procedure Stop; virtual;

    { State is now the top-most state. See @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
      docs about state lifecycle methods.
      This is called after @link(Start), it is also called
      when you pop another state, making this state the top-most. }
    procedure Resume; virtual;

    { State is no longer the top-most state. See @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
      docs about state lifecycle methods.
      This is called before @link(Stop), it is also called
      when another state is pushed over this state, so this stops
      being the the top-most state. }
