  { Google Play Game Services (achievements, leaderboards) integration.
    Right now only on Android (will simply do nothing on other platforms).

    Usage:

    @orderedList(
      @item(Create an instance of it (only a single instance allowed).)
      @item(Call @link(TGooglePlayGames.Initialize) at some point.
        Usually from @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize).
        User will be automatically asked to sign-in to Google Play then.)
      @item(Use this to manage Google Games achievements, leaderboards and so on.)
      @item(To include the necessary integration code in your Android project,
        declare your Android project type as "integrated" with
        the "google_play_games" component inside CastleEngineManifest.xml.
        See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/wiki/Android-Project-Components-Integrated-with-Castle-Game-Engine .)
