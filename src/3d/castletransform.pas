    { Prepare resources, making various methods (like rendering and such)

      It is usually simpler to call @link(TCastleViewport.PrepareResources)
      then this method. Calling @code(Viewport.PrepareResources(MyScene))
      will automatically call @code(MyScene.PrepareResources(...)) underneath,
      with proper parameters.

      It is best to call this when the rendering context is initailized,
      e.g. at Application.OnInitialize or later.
      Calling this method before the rendering context is initialized
      (e.g. from initializaton section of some unit)
      will have to skip some preparations, thus reducing the effectiveness of this method.

      This makes sure that appropriate methods execute as fast as possible.
      It's never required to call this method
      --- everything will be prepared "as needed" anyway.
      But if you allow everything to be prepared "as needed",
      then e.g. the first @link(Render) call may take a long time because it may
      have to prepare resources that will be reused in next @link(Render) calls.
      This may make your program seem slow at the beginning
      (when rendering resources are being prepared, so at the first frame,
      or a couple of first animation frames). To avoid this, call this method,
      showing the user something like "now we're preparing
      the resources --- please wait".

          left mouse button) was pressed.

          Note that the exact key or mouse responsible for this is configurable
          in our engine by Input_Interact. By default it's the left mouse button,
          as is usual for VRML/X3D browsers. But it can be configured to be other
          mouse button or a key, for example most 3D games use "e" key to interact.
        )

        @item(PointingDeviceRelease signals that the picking button is released.

          An extra parameter CancelAction indicates
          whether this pointing device "press and release" sequence may be
          considered a "click". When CancelAction = @true, then you should not make
          a "click" event (e.g. TouchSensor should not send touchTime event etc.).
        )

        @item(PointingDeviceMove signals that pointer moves over this object.)
      )

      They receive Pick information (TRayCollisionNode) about what exactly is hit
      by the 3D ray corresponding to the current pointing device position.
      It contains the detailed information about the point, triangle
      and ray (all in local coordinate system of this TCastleTransform) that are indicated
      by the pointing device.
      TRayCollisionNode.Triangle is @nil when it was not possible to determine,
      and TRayCollisionNode.Point is undefined in this case.

      They also receive Distance to the collision point,
      in world coordinates. See TRayCollision.Distance.
      The Distance may be MaxSingle when it was not possible to determine.

      There is a concept of a TCastleTransform that is currently "capturing"
      the pointing device events. Once TCastleTransform
      handles TCastleTransform.PointingDevicePress (returns @true for it),
      it captures the following PointingDeviceMove and PointingDeviceRelease events,
      regardless if ray still hits this TCastleTransform instance.
      The "capturing" instance of TCastleTransform is informed first about
      pointing device move/release.

      After the "capturing" instance,
      every pointing device event (press, release or move) is send to the leaf
      in TCastleTransform hierarchy (usually a TCastleScene) that is under the mouse/touch
      position.
      If the event is not handled, it is passed to other objects under the mouse/touch
      position.

      The PointingDeviceMove event is also always passed to @link(TCastleRootTransform.MainScene)
      at the end (if it wasn't already the "capturing" transform,
      or under the mouse/touch position).
      This way @link(TCastleRootTransform.MainScene) is always informed about pointing device movement.

      These methods are called only if the object GetExists.
      There's no need to check this condition inside the method implementation.

      This is usually called by implementation of this object,

      Changes is a set describing what changes occurred.
      See TVisibleChange docs for more information.
      It must specify all things that possibly changed.

    { Middle point, usually "eye point", of the 3D model.
      This is used for sphere center
      (if @link(CollisionSphereRadius) is non-zero or @link(Sphere) returns @true)
      and is the central point from which collisions of this object
      are checked (Move, MoveAllowed, Height, LineOfSight).
      It's useful for dynamic objects like player and moving creatures,
      which rely on @link(MoveAllowed) and gravity.

      In short, it's usually most comfortable to think about this as
      a position of the eye, or the middle of the creature's head.

      In an ideal situation, it should not be based on anything dynamic.
      For example, when this is based on the current bounding box of the animation,
      there is a risk that a large and sudden change in animation
      box could make the Middle point to jump to the other side of
      the wall (breaking collisions, as it changes Middle without a chance
      to check for collisions by MoveAllowed).
      Ideally, it should remain constant even when the shape of the object changes,
      and be possible to change only when MoveAllowed is checked
      (so only when @link(TCastleTransform.Translation) can change).

      In this class this returns something sensible above the bottom
      of the box. See @link(TCastleTransform.MiddleHeight).

      This is expressed in the parent coordinate system
      (so it is close to the @link(Translation) value, but moved up, following GravityUp).

      sphere surrounding the 3D object (it does not have to be a perfect
      bounding sphere around the object), and it may be used for some
      collisions instead of BoundingBox.
      See @link(CollidesWithMoving) and @link(MoveAllowed) for when it may happen.

      Must return @false when not GetExists (because we can't express
      "empty sphere" by @link(Sphere) method for now, but BoundingBox can express
      TBox3D.Empty).

      By default, in TCastleTransform class, this returns @true if @link(CollisionSphereRadius)
      is non-zero.

      The advantages of using a sphere, that does not have to be a perfect
      bounding sphere (it may be smaller than necessary, and only
      account e.g. for upper body part of the creature), are:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(It can have constant radius, even though the actual
          creature animates. This allows us to perfectly, reliably guarantee
          that sphere absolutely never collides with level and such.

          In case of a tight bounding volume (box or sphere) that animates,
          this guarantee is not really possible. Simply increasing time changes
          the animation to the next frame, which may be slightly larger
          in one dimension because e.g. creature moves a hand in this direction.
          This means that simply increasing time may change the non-collidable
          creature into a collidable one, if creature stands close to a wall/other
          creature and such. And we cannot simply stop/reverse an arbitrary animation
          at an arbitrary time (to avoid collision), this would look weird
          for some animations and would require some additional work
          at preparing animations and designing AI (as then "every action can
          be interrupted").

          Also using a bounding volume large enough to account for all
          possible positions is not doable, as it would be too large.
          Consider that for humanoid creatures, walking animation usually
          has tall and thin bounding box (creature stands) but dead/lying animation
          usually has flat and wide bounding box.

          So, only a bounding volume (like a sphere) that
          @italic(may be smaller than bounding volume) can remain constant
          and easily guarantee the assertion "it never collides".

          This means that using such sphere results in simpler collision
          detection routines, as they may assume that collision doesn't occur.
          In contrast, detection routines looking at our (possibly animated)
          BoundingBox must take into account that collision may already be happening,
          and they must incorporate code to allow creatures/players to "get unstruck".)

        @item(Using smaller sphere also allows to naturally ascend the stairs
          and upward slopes. Sphere can move forward slightly, and then creature
          may raise up, to reach it's preferred height. Then sphere can move
          further forward, and so on. This alllows to allow stair climbing
          for creatures without any extra effort in the code.

          The downside is that creature legs will temporarily "sink into the floor"
          when climbing up the stairs. But it's not noticeable if "growing up"
          mechanism works fast enough.)
      )

      Sphere disadvantage:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(Sphere is far from perfect as a bounding volume --- it's too small,
          sometimes also too large, sometimes both at the same time...

          Since the Sphere radius remains always the same, it must be good
          for many creature animation frames. In cases where the sphere
          isn't suitable, and you don't need advantages above --- you can
          make @name return @false.
          E.g. a dead creature may be stuck in a wall,
          and it doesn't have to climb stairs. So you don't really need
          sphere advantages listed above, and @name may return @false
          when creature is in dying state.

          But still it may be a problem sometimes, if some creature states
          have entirely different animations and bounding boxes. Then you
          will be forced to choose one universal Radius for all creature
          states. And you need constant radius to keep the advantage above
          of "guarantee".

          1. Obviously you can't set radius too small, because if it's much smaller
          than actual creature's geometry then the creature will noticeably collide
          with level geometry and other creatures.

          2. On the other hand, you can't set radius too large
          (or move sphere center, Middle, much lower).
          This would block stair climbing.

          the plane where World.GravityCoordinate (like Z or Y axis) is zero.
          The actual bottom (lowest point) of the bounding box doesn't matter.
          This means that things placed below zero plane (like a creature tentacle
          or leg) will sink into the ground, instead of causing whole creature
          to move up. It also means that the creature can easily float above
          the ground, just model it a little above the zero plane.

          In other words, this allows you to model the creature
          with respect to the ground (zero plane), which is comfortable.

          Note that setting MiddleHeight to exact 0 means that gravity will not work,
          as it means that the PreferredHeight above the ground
          is to be stuck right at the ground level.

          For gravity to work right, the MiddleHeight should be large enough
          to cause PreferredHeight to be > @link(Sphere) radius,

      This makes this object collidable with other rigid bodies

      and it allows to move and rotate because of gravity
      or because of collisions with other objects
      (if @link(TRigidBody.Dynamic) is @true).

      Setting this property makes this 3D object
      a single rigid body for the physics engine.

      If this property is assigned and the @link(TRigidBody.Dynamic) is @true
      (and @link(TRigidBody.Dynamic) is @true by default)
      then this object is moved and rotated using the physics engine.
      It will move because of gravity (if @link(TRigidBody.Gravity),
      also @true by default),
      and because of collisions with other objects.

      The @link(TRigidBody.Collider) property must be initialized
      @italic(before) assigning the @link(TRigidBody) instance here.
      So you must create a @link(TCollider) descendant, specyfying the given
      @link(TRigidBody) as a parent.
      A rigid body without a collider would in theory not collide with anything,
      and (if @link(TRigidBody.Dynamic)) would simply fall down because of gravity.
      In practice, a rigid body without a collider is simply not allowed.
      If you really need this, assign anything to @link(TRigidBody.Collider)
      and just set @link(Collides) to @false.

      @bold(Our engine (for now) also has an internal, simple physics simulation,

      So we have two independent physics systems,
      but they try to not get into each others way (they each perform
      a different task).
      In the future there will be an option to use
      the full-featured physics engine for all simulations,
      also for player and creatures, at which point our "internal physics
      simulation" will become deprecated.

        )

        @item(@link(TCastleTransform.Gravity) property @italic(only affects the
          "simple physics simulation"). It is by default @false.

          It has no effect on the "full-featured physics engine" behavior,
          that has an independent property @link(TRigidBody.Gravity),
          which is @true by default.

          You should not set both @link(TCastleTransform.Gravity) to @true
          and @link(TRigidBody.Gravity) to @true, it would mean that
          @italic(gravity simulation is performed twice).
          In the future, @link(TCastleTransform.Gravity) may be removed
          (or merged with @link(TRigidBody.Gravity), but then old games
          may by surprised by a new default @true.)

    { Direction the creature is facing, and up vector.
      These properties provide an alternative way to get and set the @link(Rotation)
      of the transformation.
      Thinking in terms of "direction" and "up" is often more natural
      when transforming creatures and player.

      The @link(Orientation) determines what is your default direction and up
      (when the @link(Rotation) is zero).
      By default we follow X3D standard vectors suitable for gravity along
      the Y axis. So direction is -Z (DefaultCameraDirection),
      up is +Y (DefaultCameraUp).

      The @link(Direction) and @link(Up) vectors should always be normalized
      (have length 1). When setting them by these properties, we will normalize
      them automatically.

      They must also always be orthogonal.
      When setting @link(Direction), @link(Up) will always be automatically
      adjusted to be orthogonal to @link(Direction). And vice versa ---
      when setting @link(Up), @link(Direction) will be adjusted.

      ADir and AUp given here do not have to be normalized

      They will be automatically fixed to be orthogonal, if necessary:
      when AdjustUp = @true (the default) we will adjust the up vector
      (preserving the given direction value),

      This is similar to assigning @link(Up) vector using it's property setter,
      but different behavior happens when we need to fix vectors to have
      direction orthogonal to up (which must be always true).
      In case of assigning @link(Up) by property setter,
      the @link(Direction) vector is changed (if necessary, to be orthogonal to up).
      In case of this method, the up vector is changed (if necessary,
      to be orthogonal to direction).

      This describes collision resolution with almost everything --- camera,
      player (in third-person perspective, camera may differ from player),
      other creatures. That is because everything
      resolves collisions through our methods MoveCollision and HeightCollision
      (high-level) or SegmentCollision, SphereCollision, SphereCollision2D,
      PointCollision2D, BoxCollision (low-level).

      (Note that RayCollision is excluded from this,
      it exceptionally ignores Collides value, as it's primarily used for picking.
      Same for SegmentCollision with LineOfSight=true.)

      The only exception are the collisions with TCastleMoving instances
      (movable world parts like elevators and doors) that have their own
      detection routines and look at CollidesWithMoving property of other objects.
      That is, the TCastleMoving instance itself must still have Collides = @true,
      but it interacts with @italic(other) objects if and only if they have
      CollidesWithMoving = @true (ignoring their Collides value).
      This allows items to be moved by elevators, but still player and creatures

    { Central camera, that controls the features that require
      a single "main" camera (features that do not make sense
      with multiple cameras from multiple viewports).

      This camera controls:

      - the X3D nodes that "sense" camera like ProximitySensor, Billboard, LOD.
      - an audio listener (controlling the spatial sound).
      - the headlight position/direction.
      - when X3D nodes change Viewport/NavigationInfo,
        they apply these changes to this camera.

      Note that it means that "headlight" is assigned to one camera
      in case of multiple viewports looking at the same world.
      You cannot have a different "headlight" in each viewport,
      this would cause subtle problems since it's not how it would work in reality
      (where every light is visible in all viewports),
      e.g. mirror textures (like GeneratedCubeMapTexture)
      would need different contents in different viewpoints.

      Note that features like LOD or Billboard or ProximitySensor
      need to transform this camera to scene local space.
      Which is not possible if the same scene instance
      is used multiple times (e.g. under many different TCastleTransform parents).
      If you need to use these features of TCastleScene,
      then simply do not use the same scene reference multiple times
      (instead clone the scene by @link(TCastleScene.Clone)).

      By default this is set to @link(TCastleViewport.Camera) of the @link(TCastleViewport)
      that created this @link(TCastleAbstractRootTransform) instance.
      So in simple cases (when you just create one @link(TCastleViewport)
      and add your scenes to it's already-created @link(TCastleViewport.Items))
      you don't have to do anything, it just works.
      In general, you can change this to any camera of any associated @link(TCastleViewport),
      or @nil (in case no camera should be that "central" camera). }

    How situation with List = nil may happen? When our List is destroyed,
    it calls B.FreeNotification on all it's items, so it (falsely) seems we will
    not get any more notifications.

    It turns out that we may get notifications,
    and they are notifications about our own destruction (AComponent = Self).
    That is because TComponent.Notification passes down the notification to
    all it's FComponents, that is rtl/objpas/classes/compon.inc
    (in FPC sources) contains code

    Procedure TComponent.Notification(AComponent: TComponent; Operation: TOperation);

      ...
      For Runner:=0 To FComponents.Count-1 do
        TComponent(FComponents.Items[Runner]).Notification(AComponent,Operation);
    end;

    And FComponents contain all components that are owned.
    So we are informed when something is removed from the owner,
    including about our own removal. (And in this case, we are a TCastleTransform descendant
    ourselves, just like our children; so check "AComponent is TCastleTransform" doesn't
    protect us.)
    Practical situation when it happens is in testcases
    TTestCastleTransform.TestNotifications and TTestCastleTransform.TestNotificationsSceneManager. }

          But actually it's OK when Sphere is used, because then wall-sliding
          in MoveCollision can correct new position,
          so actually it will be slightly above the ground. So falling
          down will work.

          But when Sphere is not used, the situation is worse,
          because then MoveCollision doesn't do wall-sliding.
          And it will always simply reject such move
          with MaximumFallingDistance.
          If FPS is low (so we would like to fall down at once
          by large distance), this is noticeable: in such case, instead
          of falling down, creature hangs over the ground,
          because MoveCollision simply doesn't allow it fall
          exactly by AboveHeight - PreferredHeight.
          So MaximumFallingDistance has to be a little smaller in this case.
          In particular, this was noticeable for the initially dead alien
          creature on "Doom" level, when shadows were on (when shadows were on,
          FPS is low, that's why the bug was noticeable only with shadows = on).

          TODO: the better version would be to improve
          MoveCollision for Sphere=false case, instead of
