    { Control may do here anything that must be continously repeated.
      E.g. camera handles here falling down due to gravity,
      rotating model in Examine mode, and many more.

      @param(SecondsPassed Should be calculated like TFramesPerSecond.UpdateSecondsPassed,
        and usually it's in fact just taken from TCastleWindowCustom.Fps.UpdateSecondsPassed.)

      This method may be used, among many other things, to continously
      react to the fact that user pressed some key (or mouse button).
      For example, if holding some key should move some 3D object,
      you should do something like:

@longCode(#
if HandleInput then
begin
  if Container.Pressed[K_Right] then
    Transform.Position += Vector3Single(SecondsPassed * 10, 0, 0);
  HandleInput := not ExclusiveEvents;
end;
#)

      Instead of directly using a key code, consider also
      using TInputShortcut that makes the input key nicely configurable.
      See engine tutorial about handling inputs.

      Multiplying movement by SecondsPassed makes your
      operation frame-rate independent. Object will move by 10
      units in a second, regardless of how many FPS your game has.

      The code related to HandleInput is important if you write
      a generally-useful control that should nicely cooperate with all other
      controls, even when placed on top of them or under them.
      The correct approach is to only look at pressed keys/mouse buttons
      if HandleInput is @true. Moreover, if you did check
      that HandleInput is @true, and you did actually handle some keys,
      then you have to set @code(HandleInput := not ExclusiveEvents).
      As ExclusiveEvents is @true in normal circumstances,
      this will prevent the other controls (behind the current control)
      from handling the keys (they will get HandleInput = @false).
      And this is important to avoid doubly-processing the same key press,
      e.g. if two controls react to the same key, only the one on top should
      process it.

      Note that to handle a single press / release (like "switch
      light on when pressing a key") you should rather
      use @link(Press) and @link(Release) methods. Use this method
      only for continous handling (like "holding this key makes
      the light brighter and brighter").

      To understand why such HandleInput approach is needed,
      realize that the "Update" events are called
      differently than simple mouse and key events like "Press" and "Release".
      "Press" and "Release" events
      return whether the event was somehow "handled", and the container
      passes them only to the controls under the mouse (decided by
      @link(TUIControl.CapturesEventsAtPosition)). And as soon as some control says it "handled"
      the event, other controls (even if under the mouse) will not
      receive the event.

      This approach is not suitable for Update events. Some controls
      need to do the Update job all the time,
      regardless of whether the control is under the mouse and regardless
      of what other controls already did. So all controls (well,
      all controls that exist, in case of TUIControl,
      see TUIControl.GetExists) receive Update calls.

      So the "handled" status is passed through HandleInput.
      If a control is not under the mouse, it will receive HandleInput
      = @false. If a control is under the mouse, it will receive HandleInput
      = @true as long as no other control on top of it didn't already
      change it to @false. }

      with already initialized OpenGL context. If inserting into the container/parent
      without OpenGL context initialized, it will be called later,
      when OpenGL context will get initialized, right after GLContextOpen.

  { Handle user navigation in 3D scene.
    You control camera parameters and provide user input
    to this class by various methods and properties.
    You can investigate the current camera configuration by many methods,
    the most final is the @link(Matrix) method that
    generates a simple 4x4 camera matrix.

    This class is not tied to any OpenGL specifics, any VRML specifics,
    and CastleWindow etc. --- this class is fully flexible and may be used
    in any 3D program, whether using CastleWindow, OpenGL etc. or not.

    Various TCamera descendants implement various navigation
    methods, for example TExamineCamera allows the user to rotate
    and scale the model (imagine that you're holding a 3D model in your
    hands and you look at it from various sides) and TWalkCamera
    implements typical navigation in the style of first-person shooter
    games.

    The most comfortable way to use a camera is with a scene manager
    (TCastleSceneManager). You can create your camera instance,
    call it's @code(Init) method (this is initializes most important properties),
    and assign it to TCastleSceneManager.Camera property.
    This way SceneManager will pass all necessary window events to the camera,
    and when drawing SceneManager will load camera matrix like
    @code(glLoadMatrix(Camera.Matrix);).
    In fact, if you do not assign anything to TCastleSceneManager.Camera property,
    then the default camera will be created for you. So @italic(when
    using TCastleSceneManager, you do not have to do anything to use a camera)
    --- default camera will be created and automatically used for you. }

      When we're during camera animation, @link(Update) doesn't do other stuff
      (e.g. gravity for TWalkCamera doesn't work, rotating for TExamineCamera
      doesn't work). This also means that the key/mouse controls of the camera
      do not work. Instead, we remember the source and target position
      (at the time AnimateTo was called) of the camera,
      and smoothly interpolate camera parameters to match the target.

      Once the animation stops, @link(Update) goes back to normal: gravity
      in TWalkCamera works again, rotating in TExamineCamera works again etc.

    { @abstract(DoMoveAllowed will be used when user will move in the scene,
      i.e. when user will want to change @link(Position).)

      ProposedNewPos is the position where the user wants to move
      (current user position is always stored in Position,
      so you can calculate move direction by ProposedNewPos - Position).

      This is the place to "plug in" your collision detection
      into camera.

      Returns false if no move is allowed.
      Otherwise returns true and sets NewPos to the position
      where user should be moved. E.g. if you're doing a simple
      test for collisions (with yes/no results), you will always
      want to set NewPos to ProposedNewPos when returning true.
      But you can also do more sophisticated calculations and
      sometimes not allow user to move to ProposedNewPos, but allow
      him to move instead to some other close position.
      E.g. look what's happening in quake (or just any first-person
      3d game) when you're trying to walk "into the wall"
      at angle like 30 degrees: you're blocked,
      i.e. you obviously can't walk into the wall, but your position
      changes a bit and you're slowly moving alongside the wall.
      That's how you can use NewPos: you can return true and set
      NewPos to something that is not exactly ProposedNewPos
      (but is close to ProposedNewPos).

      Note that it's allowed to modify NewPos when returning false.
      This is meaningless, but may be comfortable for implementor
      of DoMoveAllowed.

      BecauseOfGravity says whether this move is caused by gravity
      dragging the camera down. Can happen only if @link(Gravity)
      is @true. You can use BecauseOfGravity to control DoMoveAllowed
      behavior --- e.g. view3dscene will not allow camera to move
      lower that some minimal plane when BecauseOfGravity
      (because this would mean that camera falls down infinitely),
      on the other hand when BecauseOfGravity is @false moving
      outside bounding box is allowed (to allow camera to look at the
      scene from "the outside").

      Basic implementation of DoMoveAllowed in this class:
      If OnMoveAllowed = nil then returns true and sets NewPos to
      ProposedNewPos (so move is always allowed).
      Else calls OnMoveAllowed. }
    function DoMoveAllowed(const ProposedNewPos: TVector3Single;
      out NewPos: TVector3Single;
      const BecauseOfGravity: boolean): boolean; virtual;

    { Camera position, looking direction and up vector.

      Initially (after creating this object) they are equal to
      InitialPosition, InitialDirection, InitialUp.
      Also @link(Init) and @link(GoToInitial) methods reset them to these
      initial values.

      The @link(Direction) and @link(Up) vectors should always be normalized
      (have length 1). When setting them by these properties, we will normalize
      them automatically.

      Note that since engine >= 2.2.0 the @link(Direction) vector
      should always be normalized (length 1), and so you cannot change
      move speed by scaling this vector.
      Use MoveSpeed, MoveHorizontalSpeed, MoveVerticalSpeed instead.

      This is also the "normal" value for both @link(Up) and
      InitialUp --- one that means that player is looking straight
      foward. This is used for features like PreferGravityUpForRotations
      and/or PreferGravityUpForMoving.

      With PreferGravityUpForRotations, this affects rotations:
      horizontal rotations (Input_LeftRot and Input_RightRot)
      and rotations caused by MouseLook.
      Also vertical rotations are bounded by MinAngleRadFromGravityUp
      when PreferGravityUpForRotations.

      Note that you can change it freely at runtime,
      and when you set PreferGravityUpForRotations from @false to @true
      then in nearest Update
      calls @link(Up) will be gradually fixed, so that @link(Direction) and @link(Up)
      and GravityUp are on the same plane. Also @link(Direction) may be adjusted
      to honour MinAngleRadFromGravityUp.

      With PreferGravityUpForMoving, this affects moving:
      horizontal moving (forward, backward, strafe),
      and vertical moving (Input_Jump and Input_Crouch when @link(Gravity) is @false).
      E.g. when PreferGravityUpForMoving then forward/backward keys are tied
      to horizontal plane defined by GravityUp.
      When not PreferGravityUpForMoving then forward/backward try to move
      you just in the @link(Direction). Which is usually more handy when
      e.g. simulating flying.

      It's a delicate decision how to set them, because generally
      all the decisions are "somewhat correct" --- they just sometimes
      "feel incorrect" for player.

      @unorderedList(
        @item(
          First of all, if the scene is not "naturally oriented"
          around GravityUp, then you @bold(may) set
          PreferGravityUpForRotations as @false and you @bold(should)
          leave PreferGravityUpForMoving and @link(Gravity) to @false.

          By the scene "naturally oriented around GravityUp"
          I mean that we have some proper GravityUp,
          not just some guessed GravityUp that may
          be incorrect. For example when view3dscene loads a VRML model
          without any camera definition then it assumes that "up vector"
          is (0, 1, 0), because this is more-or-less VRML standard
          suggested by VRML spec. But this may be very inappopriate,
          for example the scene may be actually oriented with (0, 0, 1)
          up vector in mind.

          Other examples of the scenes without any
          "naturally oriented around GravityUp" may be some
          "outer space" scene without any gravity.)

        @item(
          With PreferGravityUpForRotations the "feeling" of GravityUp
          is stronger for user, because GravityUp, @link(Up) and @link(Direction)
          always define the same plane in 3D space (i.e. along with the
          4th point, (0, 0, 0), for camera eye). Raising/bowing the head
          doesn't break this assumption.

          Without PreferGravityUpForRotations, we quickly start to do rotations
          in an awkward way --- once you do some vertical rotation,
          you changed @link(Up), and next horizontal rotation will be
          done versus new @link(Up).

          If your GravityUp is good, then you generally should
          leave PreferGravityUpForRotations to @true. Unless you really @bold(want)
          the player to feel movements as "awkward", e.g. when you
          want to simulate this "outer space without any gravity" feeling.)

        @item(
          If your GravityUp is good, then you generally should set
          PreferGravityUpForMoving just like Gravity.

          E.g. when the player is flying / swimming etc. he will probably prefer
          PreferGravityUpForMoving = @false, because this way he will not have to
          press Input_Jump and Input_Crouch. Simply pressing Input_Forward
          and Input_Backward and doing rotations will be enough to move
          freely in 3D space.

    { Things related to gravity ---------------------------------------- }

    { This unlocks a couple of features and automatic behaviors
      related to gravity. Gravity always drags the camera down to
      -GravityUp.

      Summary of things done by gravity:
      @unorderedList(
        @item(It uses OnHeight to get camera height above the ground.)
        @item(It allows player to jump. See Input_Jump, IsJumping, JumpMaxHeight,
          JumpHorizontalSpeedMultiply.)
        @item(It allows player to crouch. See Input_Crouch, CrouchHeight.)
        @item(It tries to keep @link(Position) above the ground on
          PreferredHeight height.)
        @item(When current height is too small --- @link(Position) is moved up.
          See GrowSpeed.)
        @item(When current height is too large --- we're falling down.
          See Falling, OnFall, FallSpeedStart,
          FallSpeedIncrease, FallingEffect.)
        @item(It does head bobbing. See HeadBobbing, HeadBobbingTime.)
      )

      While there are many properties allowing you to control
      gravity behavior, most of them have initial values that should be
      sensible in all cases. The only things that you really want to take
      care of are: OnHeight and PreferredHeight.
      Everything else should basically work auto-magically.

      Note that Gravity setting is independent from
      PreferGravityUpForRotations or PreferGravityUpForMoving settings ---
      PreferGravityUpXxx say how the player controls work,
      Gravity says what happens to player due to ... well, due to gravity. }
    property Gravity: boolean
      read FGravity write FGravity default false;

    { When @link(Gravity) is on, @link(Position) tries to stay PreferredHeight
      above the ground. Temporary it may be lower (player can
      shortly "duck" when he falls from high).

      This must always be >= 0.
      You should set this to something greater than zero to get sensible
      behavior of some things related to @link(Gravity),
      and also you should set OnHeight.

      See CorrectPreferredHeight for important property
      of PreferredHeight that you should keep. }
    property PreferredHeight: Single
      read FPreferredHeight write FPreferredHeight default 0.0;

    { This procedure corrects PreferredHeight based on your Radius
      and on current HeadBobbing.

      Exactly what and why is done: if you do any kind of collision
      detection with some Radius, then
      you should make sure that RealPreferredHeight is always >= of your
      Radius, otherwise strange effects may happen when crouching
      or when head bobbing forces camera to go down.

      Exactly, the required equation is
@preformatted(
  MinimumRealPreferredHeight :=
    PreferredHeight * CrouchHeight * (1 - HeadBobbing);
)
      and always must be
@preformatted(
  MinimumRealPreferredHeight >= RealPreferredHeight
)

      Reasoning: otherwise this class would "want camera to fall down"
      (because we will always be higher than RealPreferredHeight)
      but your OnMoveAllowed would not allow it (because Radius
      would not allow it). Note that this class doesn't keep value
      of your Radius, because collision detection
      is (by design) never done by this class --- it's always
      delegated to OnHeight and OnMoveAllowed.
      Also, it's not exactly forced @italic(how) you should force this
      condition to hold. Sometimes the good solution is to adjust
      Radius, not to adjust PreferredHeight.

      Anyway, this method will make sure that this condition
      holds by eventually adjusting (making larger) PreferredHeight.
      Note that for Radius = 0.0 this will always leave
      PreferredHeight as it is. }

    { The tallest height that you can climb.
      This is checked in each single horizontal move when @link(Gravity) works.
      Must be >= 0. Value 0 means there is no limit (and makes a small speedup).

      This is reliable to prevent user from climbing stairs and such,
      when vertical walls are really vertical (not just steep-almost-vertical).

      It's not 100% reliable to prevent player from climbing steep hills.
      That's because, depending on how often an event processing occurs,
      you actually climb using less or more steps.
      So even a very steep hill can be always
      climbed on a computer with very fast speed, because with large FPS you
      effectively climb it using a lot of very small steps (assuming that
      FPS limit is not enabled, that is CastleWindow.TCastleApplication.LimitFPS
      or CastleControl.LimitFPS is zero).

      Remember that user can still try jumping to climb on high obstactes.
      See JumpMaxHeight for a way to control jumping.

      For a 100% reliable way to prevent user from reaching some point,
      that does not rely on specific camera/gravity settings,
      you should build actual walls in 3D (invisible walls
      can be created by Collision.proxy in VRML/X3D). }

  { Shortcuts: I'll try to make them intelligent, which means
    "mostly matching shortcuts in other programs" (like Blender) and
    "accessible to all users" (which means that e.g. I don't want to use
    middle mouse button, as many users have only 2 mouse buttons (or even 1),
    besides GNOME hig says users seldom try out other than the 1st button).

    Let's check what others use:

    Blender:
    - rotating: on bmMiddle
    - moving left/right/down/up: on Shift + mbMiddle
    - moving closer/further: on Ctrl + mbMiddle
      (moving down brings closer, up brings further; horizontal move ignored)
    Both Shift and Ctrl pressed do nothing.

    vrweb:
    - rotating: mbMiddle
    - moving closer/further: mbRight (like in Blender: down closer, up further,
      horizontal doesn't matter)
    - moving left/right/down/up: mbLeft

    GIMP normalmap 3d preview:
    - rotating: mbLeft
    - moving closer/further: mbRight (like in Blender: down closer, up further,
      horizontal doesn't matter)
    - no moving left/right/down/up.

    My thoughts and conclusions:
    - rotating seems most natural in Examine mode (that's where this navigation
      mode is the most comfortable), so it should be on mbLeft (like normalmap)
      with no modifiers (like Blender).
    - moving closer/further: 2nd most important action in Examine mode, IMO.
      Goes to mbRight. For people with 1 mouse button, and for Blender analogy,
      it's also on Ctrl + mbLeft.
    - moving left/right/down/up: mbMiddle.
      For people with no middle button, and Blender analogy, it's also on
      Shift + mbLeft.

    This achieves a couple of nice goals:
    - everything is available with only mbLeft, for people with 1 mouse button.
    - Blender analogy: you can say to just switch "mbMiddle" to "mbLeft",
      and it works the same
    - OTOH, for people with 3 mouse buttons, that do not catch the fact that
      keyboard modifiers change the navigation, also each mb (without modifier)
      does something different.

        This should happen only if your code was changing values of
        PreferGravityUpForRotations and MinAngleRadFromGravityUp at runtime.
        E.g. first you let Direction and Up to be incorrect,
        and then you set PreferGravityUpForRotations to @true and
        MinAngleRadFromGravityUp
        to > 0 --- and suddenly we find that Up can be temporarily bad. }

        So just pick any sensible FDirection to satisfy MinAngleRadFromGravityUp
        for sure.

        This is a common problem on some VRML models:
        - You wanted to place your camera such that camera looking direction
          is in +Y or -Y (and camera up is e.g. +Z).
        - You did this by using untransformed PerspectiveCamera/Viewpoint node.
        But VRML (2.0 spec, I also do this in VMRL 1.0)
        gravity is set by transforming (0, 1, 0) by PerspectiveCamera/Viewpoint
        node transformation.
        So the above will mean that gravity vector is parallel to your

        we are not above the ground, or
          AboveHeight >=
            RealPreferredHeight - RealPreferredHeightMargin
        However we require something stronger to continue:
          AboveHeight >
            RealPreferredHeight + RealPreferredHeightMargin

        This is important, because this way we avoid the unpleasant
        "bouncing" effect when in one Update we decide that camera
        is falling down, in next Update we decide that it's growing,
        in next Update it falls down again etc. In TryGrow we try
        to precisely set our Position, so that it hits exactly
        at RealPreferredHeight -- which means that after TryGrow,
        in next Update TryGrow should not cause growing and TryFalling
        should not cause falling down. }

      { Make sure that FallSpeed is initialized.
        When Falling, we know it's initialized (because setting
        "FFalling := true;" is done only in the piece of code below...),
        otherwise we make sure it's set to it's starting value. }
      if not FFalling then
        FFallSpeed := FallSpeedStart;

      { try to fall down }
      PositionBefore := Position;

      { calculate FallingVectorLength.

        Note that we make sure that FallingVectorLength is no longer
        than AboveHeight --- this way we avoid the problem
        that when FFallSpeed would get very big,
        we couldn't fall down any more (while in fact we should then fall down
        very quickly).

        Actually, we even do more. We make sure that
        FallingVectorLength is no longer than
        (AboveHeight - RealPreferredHeight).
        Initially I wanted to do here
          MinVar(FallingVectorLength, AboveHeight);
        i.e. to allow camera to fall below RealPreferredHeight.

        But this didn't work like it should. Why ?
        See above for the trick that I have to do with
        RealPreferredHeightMargin above (to not cause
        "unpleasant bouncing" when swapping Falling and TryGrow).
        If I could fall down here below RealPreferredHeight then

        1. It *will not* cause the desired "nice" effect (of automatically
           "ducking" when falling down from high), because of comparison
           (the one with RealPreferredHeightMargin) above.

        2. It *will* cause the undesired unpleasant swapping between
           Falling and TryGrow.

        So it's totally bad thing to do.

        This means that I should limit myself to not fall down
        below RealPreferredHeight. And that's what I'm doing. }
      FallingVectorLength :=
        MoveSpeed * MoveVerticalSpeed * FFallSpeed * SecondsPassed;
      MinVar(FallingVectorLength, AboveHeight - RealPreferredHeight);

      if Move(VectorScale(GravityUp, - FallingVectorLength), true, false) and
        (not VectorsPerfectlyEqual(Position, PositionBefore)) then
      begin
        if not Falling then
        begin
          FFallingStartPosition := PositionBefore;

          { Why do I init here FFallSpeed ? A few lines above I did
              if not FFalling then
                FFallSpeed := FallSpeedStart;
            to init FFallSpeed (I had to do it to calculate
            FallingVectorLength). So why initing it again here ?

            Answer: Because Move above called MoveTo, that set Position
            that actually called ScheduleVisibleChange that possibly
            called OnVisibleChange.
            And OnVisibleChange is used callback and user could do there
            things like
            - Changing FallSpeedStart (but still it's unspecified
              whether we have to apply this change, right ?)
            - Calling CancelFalling and *then* changing FallSpeedStart.
              And in this case, we *must* honour it, because here user
              expects that we will use FallSpeedStart if we want
              to fall down. (of course, one call to "Move" with old
              "FallSpeedStart" was already done, that's unavoidable...). }
          FFallSpeed := FallSpeedStart;

          FFalling := true;
        end;

        Result := true;

        if AboveHeight < RealPreferredHeight * 1.1 then
        begin
          { This check is needed, otherwise when you're walking down even from
            the most slight hill then you get

            1. FallingEffect
            2. OnFall is called seldom and with large heights.

            Why ? Because MoveHorizontal calls are done between GravityUpdate
            calls, and the move can be quite fast. So even though the player is
            actually quite closely following the terrain, we would constantly
            have Falling := true. Consider a large hill that is almost
            flat --- when walking down the hill, we would get Falling
            := true, FallSpeed and FallingEffect would raise,
            and at the end OnFall would be called with parameters
            like player fell down from the top of the hill to the ground
            (which can cause e.g. player losing life).

            The check for RealPreferredHeight * 1.1 above and
            setting FFalling cure the situation. OnFall will
            be called more often indicating very small fallen down heights,
            and FallSpeed and FallingEffect will not be able
            to raise high as long as player follows terrain closely.

            Of course we're setting here FFalling := false even though
            the player is not exactly on the terrain --- but he's very close.
            In the next GravityUpdate call we will again bring him a little
            down, set FFalling to @true, and then set it back to @false
            by line below. }
          FFalling := false;
        end else
        begin
          { This is where we do FallingEffect.

            Note that I do FallingEffect *before* increasing
            FFallSpeed below.

            1. reason (ideological, not really that important...) is that
               FallingEffect is a penalty equivalent to FFallSpeed that
               was already used --- not to the future FFallSpeed.

            2. reason (practical, and real :) is that when the program
               was in some non-3d drawing state (e.g. displaying menu, or
               displaying progress bar because the VRML model was just loaded)
               then SecondsPassed indicates (truly) that a lot of time elapsed
               since last Update. This means that it's common that at the same moment
               when Falling changed suddenly to @true, SecondsPassed may be large
               and we're better not using this too much... A practical bug demo:
               open in view3dscene (it does progress bar in OpenGL, so will cause
               large SecondsPassed) any model with gravity on and camera slightly
               higher then PreferredHeight (we want to trigger Falling
               right when the model is loaded). E.g. run
               "view3dscene demo_models/navigation/speed_2.wrl".
               If FallSpeedIncrease will be done before FallingEffect,
               then you'll see that at the very first frame FFallSpeed
               was increased so much (because SecondsPassed was large) that it triggered
               FallingEffect. Even though the falling down distance was really small...

               Maybe in the future I'll workaround it differently.
               One idea is that FFallSpeed should be made smaller if the
               falled down distance is small. Or just don't call GravityUpdate after the first
               model load, to avoid using large SecondsPassed ?

               LATER NOTE: note that the (2.) problem above may be non-existing
               now, since we use SecondsPassed and we have ZeroNextSecondsPassed to
               set SecondsPassed to zero in such cases. }

      1. Older approach was to reposition only at UpdateMouseLook,
         which was automatically called by camera's SetMouseLook.
         But this turned out to reposition mouse too often:

         MouseLook may be true for a very short time.

         For example, consider castle, where MouseLook is usually true
         during the game, but it's off in game menu (TCastleOnScreenMenu) and start screen.
         So when you're in the game, and choose "End game", game menu
         closes (immediately bringing back MouseLook = true by TGLMode.Destroy
         restoring everything), but game mode immediately closes and goes
         back to start screen. Effect: mouse cursor is forced to the middle
         of the screen, without any apparent (for user) reason.

      2. Later approach: just not reposition mouse at all just
         because MoseLook = true.  Only reposition from
         TWalkCamera.Motion.

         This requires the Motion handler to only work when initial
         mouse position is at the screen middle,
         otherwise initial mouse look would generate large move.
         But in fact TWalkCamera.Motion already does this, so it's all Ok.

         Unfortunately, this isn't so nice: sometimes you really want your
         mouse repositioned even before you move it:
         - e.g. when entering castle game, it's strange that mouse cursor
           is temporarily visible, until you move the mouse.
         - worse: when mouse cursor is outside castle window, you have
           to move mouse first over the window, before mouse look catches up.

      So we have to reposition the mouse, but not too eagerly.
      Update seems a good moment. }

            How to apply SecondsPassed here ?
            I can't just ignore SecondsPassed, but I can't also write
              FMoveSpeed *= 10 * SecondsPassed;
            What I want is such continous function that e.g.
              F(FMoveSpeed, 10) = F(F(FMoveSpeed, 1), 1)
            I.e. SecondsPassed = 10 should work just like doing the same change twice.
            So F is FMoveSpeed * Power(10, SecondsPassed)
            Easy!

    { Note that setting MousePosition may (but doesn't have to)
      generate another Motion in the container to destination position.
      This can cause some problems:

      1. Consider this:

         - player moves mouse to MiddleX-10
         - Motion is generated, I rotate camera by "-10" horizontally
         - Setting MousePosition sets mouse to the Middle,
           but this time no Motion is generated
         - player moved mouse to MiddleX+10. Although mouse was
           positioned on Middle, TCastleWindowCustom thinks that the mouse
           is still positioned on Middle-10, and I will get "+20" move
           for player (while I should get only "+10")

         Fine solution for this would be to always subtract
         MiddleWidth and MiddleHeight below
         (instead of previous values, OldX and OldY).
         But this causes another problem:

      2. What if player switches to another window, moves the mouse,
         than goes alt+tab back to our window ? Next mouse move will
         be stupid, because it's really *not* from the middle of the screen.

      The solution for both problems: you have to check that previous
      position, OldX and OldY, are indeed equal to
      MiddleWidth and MiddleHeight. This way we know that
      this is good move, that qualifies to perform mouse move.

      And inside, we can calculate the difference
      by subtracing new - old position, knowing that old = middle this
      will always be Ok.

      Later: see TCastleWindowCustom.UpdateMouseLook implementation notes,
      we actually depend on the fact that MouseLook checks and works
      only if mouse position is at the middle. }

  { Note that both Xxx.SetView calls below do Xxx.VisibleChange at the end,
    which in turn call our own ScheduleVisibleChange.

    Using Begin/EndVisibleChangeSchedule is more than just an optimization
    (to avoid calling our own VisibleChange at least twice) here.
    It is actually required for correctness.
    That is becasue VisibleChange method may be overriden and/or call various
    callbacks that may in turn change the camera again.

    - So these VisibleChange callbacks should be called only once our state
      is consistent, not in the middle (like at the end of FExamine.SetView,
      when FExamine state is not consistent with FWalk state yet).

    - Also, there are cases when variable aliasing would cause our const
      parameters to change. Consider view3dscene with
      demo_models/navigation/transition_multiple_viewpoints.x3dv ,
      when transition 1 ends: our TCamera.Update will then
      call TUniversalCamera.SetView with AnimationEndXxx parameters.
      Without Begin/EndVisibleChangeSchedule, the VisibleChange calls
      inside will cause TCastleSceneCore.CameraChanged
      that causes NavigationInfo.transitionComplete event,

{ This was initially based on Stephen Chenney's ANSI C code orient.c,
  available still from here: http://vrmlworks.crispen.org/tools.html
  I rewrote it a couple of times, possibly removing and possibly adding
  some bugs :)

  Idea: we want to convert CamDir and CamUp into VRML orientation,
  which is a rotation from DefaultCameraDirection/DefaultCameraUp into CamDir/Up.

  1) Take vector orthogonal to standard DefaultCameraDirection and CamDir.
     Rotate around it, to match DefaultCameraDirection with CamDir.

  2) Now rotate around CamDir such that standard up (already rotated
     by 1st transform) matches with CamUp. We know it's possible,
     since CamDir and CamUp are orthogonal and normalized,
     just like standard DefaultCameraDirection/DefaultCameraUp.

  Combine these two rotations and you have the result.

  How to combine two rotations, such that in the end you get nice
  single rotation? That's where quaternions rule.

  NormalizeVar(CamUp);

  { calculate Rot1Quat }
  Rot1Axis := VectorProduct(DefaultCameraDirection, CamDir);
  { Rot1Axis may be zero if DefaultCameraDirection and CamDir are parallel.
    When they point in the same direction, then it doesn't matter
    (rotation will be by 0 angle anyway), but when they are in opposite
    direction we want to do some rotation, so we need some non-zero
    sensible Rot1Axis. }
  if ZeroVector(Rot1Axis) then
    Rot1Axis := DefaultCameraUp else
    { Normalize *after* checking ZeroVector, otherwise normalization
      could change some almost-zero vector into a (practically random)
      vector of length 1. }

  Rot1CosAngle := VectorDotProduct(DefaultCameraDirection, CamDir);
  Rot1Quat := QuatFromAxisAngleCos(Rot1Axis, Rot1CosAngle);

  { calculate Rot2Quat }
  StdCamUpAfterRot1 := Rot1Quat.Rotate(DefaultCameraUp);
  { We know Rot2Axis should be either CamDir or -CamDir. But how do we know
    which one? (To make the rotation around it in correct direction.)
    Calculating Rot2Axis below is a solution. }
  Rot2Axis := VectorProduct(StdCamUpAfterRot1, CamUp);

  (*We could now do NormalizeVar(Rot2Axis),
    after making sure it's not zero. Like

    { we need larger epsilon for ZeroVector below, in case
      StdCamUpAfterRot1 is = -CamUp.
      testcameras.pas contains testcases that require it. }
    if ZeroVector(Rot2Axis, 0.001) then
      Rot2Axis := CamDir else
      { Normalize *after* checking ZeroVector, otherwise normalization
        could change some almost-zero vector into a (practically random)
        vector of length 1. }
      NormalizeVar(Rot2Axis);

    And later do

      { epsilon for VectorsEqual 0.001 is too small }
      Assert( VectorsEqual(Rot2Axis,  CamDir, 0.01) or
              VectorsEqual(Rot2Axis, -CamDir, 0.01),
        Format('CamDirUp2OrientQuat failed for CamDir, CamUp: (%s), (%s)',
          [ VectorToRawStr(CamDir), VectorToRawStr(CamUp) ]));

    However, as can be seen in above comments, this requires some careful
    adjustments of epsilons, so it's somewhat numerically unstable.
    It's better to just use now the knowledge that Rot2Axis
    is either CamDir or -CamDir, and choose one of them. *)
