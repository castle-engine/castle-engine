      If not IsRadius, or if checking for collisions with sphere is not possible
      for some reasons, then you can check for collisions with boxes.
      OldBox should usually be ignored (it can be useful when collision-checking
      has to be approximate in some corner cases, see TCreature.MoveCollision).
      NewBox plays the same role as "sphere centered around NewPos" in paragraph

      Setting this to @false pretty much turns everything of this 3D object
      to "off". This is useful for objects that disappear completely from
      the level when something happens. You could just as well remove
      this object from TCastleSceneManager.Items tree, but sometimes it's more
      comfortable to simply turn this property to @false.

      Every @link(Disable) call should always be paired with @link(Enable) call

      Internally, we keep a counter of how many times the object is disabled,
      and if this counter is <> 0 then GetExists returns @false.
      Using this is useful for taming collisions, especially to avoid self-collisions

      but obviously it doesn't collide with it's own bounding volume).

    { Should this 3D object participate in collision detection.
      You can turn this off, useful to make e.g. "fake" walls
      (to some secret places on level).

      This describes collision resolution with almost everything --- camera,
      player (in third-person perspective, camera may differ from player),
      other creatures. That is because everything
      resolves collisions through our methods MoveCollision and HeightCollision
      (high-level) or SegmentCollision, SphereCollision, SphereCollision2D,
      PointCollision2D, BoxCollision (low-level).

      (Note that RayCollision is excluded from this,
      it exceptionally ignores Collides value, as it's primarily used for picking.
      Same for SegmentCollision with LineOfSight=true.)

      The only exception are the collisions with T3DMoving instances
      (movable world parts like elevators and doors) that have their own
      detection routines and look at CollidesWithMoving property of other objects.
      That is, the T3DMoving instance itself must still have Collides = @true,
      but it interacts with @italic(other) objects if and only if they have
      CollidesWithMoving = @true (ignoring their Collides value).
      This allows items to be moved by elevators, but still player and creatures
      can pass through them.

      Note that if not @link(Exists) then this doesn't matter
      (not existing objects never participate in collision detection).

      This is independent from @link(Collides), as @link(RayCollision)
      does not look at @link(Collides), it only looks at @link(Pickable).

      so bounding box has to be transformed by ParentTransform.

      This requires OpenGL to be initailized for most 3D objects.
      If not, some parts of preparations will be aborted.

      This makes sure that appropriate methods execute as fast as possible.
      It's never required to call this method
      --- everything will be prepared "as needed" anyway.
      But if you allow everything to be prepared "as needed",
      then e.g. the first @link(Render) call may take a long time because it may
      have to prepare resources that will be reused in next @link(Render) calls.
      This is bad, as your program will seem very slow at the beginning
      (when rendering resources are prepared, so a first frame,
      or a couple of first frames, if it's something
      like a precalculated animation). To avoid this, call this method,
      showing the user something like "now we're preparing
      the resources --- please wait".

      For OpenGL rendered objects, this method ties this object
      to the current OpenGL context.
      But it doesn't change any OpenGL state or buffers contents
      (at most, it allocates some texture and display list names).

          in our engine by Input_Interact. By default it's the left mouse button,

      PointingDeviceMove receives Pick information about what exactly is hit
      by the 3D ray corresponding to the current mouse position.
      It contains the detailed information about 3D point, triangle
      and ray (all in local coordinate system) that are indicated by the mouse.
      PointingDeviceActivate does not receive this information now
      (because it may happen in obscure situations when ray direction is not known;
      this is all related to our "fallback to MainScene" mechanism).

      They also receive Distance to the collision,
      in world coordinates. See TRayCollision.Distance.

      The pointing device event (activation,
      deactivation or move) is send first to the innermost 3D object.
      That is, we first send this event to the first item on
      TRayCollision list corresponding to the current ray.
      This way, the innermost ("most local") 3D object has the chance
      to handle this event first. If the event is not handled, it is passed
      to other 3D objects (we simply iterate over the TRayCollision list).
      If nothing on TRayCollision list
      handled the item, it is eventually passed to main 3D scene
      (TCastleSceneManager.MainScene), if it wasn't already present on
      TRayCollision list.

      Note that when passing this event to TCastleSceneManager.MainScene,
      it is possible that 3D ray simply didn't hit anything (mouse pointer
      is over the background). In this case, TRayCollisionNode.Point
      is undefined, TRayCollisionNode.Triangle is @nil
      and Distance is MaxSingle.

      This event should be handled only if GetExists.
      Usually, 3D objects with GetExists = @false will not be returned
      by RayCollision, so they will not receive this event anyway.
      However, if 3D object may be equal to TCastleSceneManager.MainScene,
      then it should be secured and check for GetExists
      inside PointingDeviceActivate and PointingDeviceMove.

    { Unconditionally move this 3D object by given vector.
      You usually don't want to use this directly, instead use @link(Move)
      method to move checking collisions (and with optional wall sliding).

      By default, in T3D class, this does nothing, because the bare T3D
      class doesn't know how to move itself.
      But descendants like T3DTransform and T3DOrient (and their
      descendants like TPlayer, TCreature, TItemOnWorld) override this
      and can be moved using this. }

    { Middle point, usually "eye point", of the 3D model.
      This is used for sphere center (if overriden Sphere returns @true)
      and is the central point from which collisions of this object
      are checked (Move, MoveAllowed, Height, LineOfSight).
      For 3D things like level scene this is mostly useless (as you will leave
      Sphere at default @false then, and the scene itself doesn't move),
      but it's crucial for dynamic 3D things like player and moving creatures.

      In short, it's usually most comfortable to think about this as
      a position of the eye, or the middle of the creature's head.

      In an ideal situation, it should not be based on anything dynamic.
      For example, when this is based on the current bounding box of the animation,
      there is a risk that a large and sudden change in animation
      box could make the Middle point to jump to the other side of
      the wall (breaking collisions, as it changes Middle without a chance
      to check for collisions by MoveAllowed).
      Ideally, it should remain constant even when the shape of the object changes,
      and be possible to change only when MoveAllowed is checked
      (so only when T3DOrient.Position or T3DTransform.Translation can change).

      In this class this is simply zero. In the descendant
      T3DCustomTransform (ancestor of T3DTransform, T3DOrient
      that in turn are ancestors of normal creatures, items etc.)
      this is overriden to return something sensible above the bottom
      of the box. See T3DCustomTransform.MiddleHeight. }
    function Middle: TVector3Single; virtual;

    { Sector where the middle of this 3D object is.
      Used for AI. @nil if none (maybe because we're not part of any world,
      maybe because sectors of the world were not initialized,
      or maybe simply because we're outside of all sectors). }
    function Sector: TSector;

    { Can the approximate sphere (around Middle point)
      be used for some collision-detection
      tasks. If @true then Radius (and Middle point) determine the approximate
      sphere surrounding the 3D object (it does not have to be a perfect
      bounding sphere around the object), and it may be used for some
      collisions instead of BoundingBox.
      See @link(CollidesWithMoving) and @link(MoveAllowed) for when it may happen.

      Must return @false when not GetExists (because we can't express
      "empty sphere" by @link(Sphere) method for now, but BoundingBox can express
      EmptyBox3D).

      By default, in T3D class, this always returns @false
      and @link(Sphere) is undefined.

      The advantages of using a sphere, that does not have to be a perfect
      bounding sphere (it may be smaller than necessary, and only
      account e.g. for upper body part of the creature), are:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(It can have constant radius, even though the actual
          creature animates. This allows us to perfectly, reliably guarantee
          that sphere absolutely never collides with level and such.

          In case of a tight bounding volume (box or sphere) that animates,
          this guarantee is not really possible. Simply increasing time changes
          the animation to the next frame, which may be slightly larger
          in one dimension because e.g. creature moves a hand in this direction.
          This means that simply increasing time may change the non-collidable
          creature into a collidable one, if creature stands close to a wall/other
          creature and such. And we cannot simply stop/reverse an arbitrary animation
          at an arbitrary time (to avoid collision), this would look weird
          for some animations and would require some additional work
          at preparing animations and designing AI (as then "every action can
          be interrupted").

          Also using a bounding volume large enough to account for all
          possible positions is not doable, as it would be too large.
          Consider that for humanoid creatures, walking animation usually
          has tall and thin bounding box (creature stands) but dead/lying animation
          usually has flat and wide bounding box.

          So, only a bounding volume (like a sphere) that
          @italic(may be smaller than bounding volume) can remain constant
          and easily guarantee the assertion "it never collides".

          This means that using such sphere results in simpler collision
          detection routines, as they may assume that collision doesn't occur.
          In contrast, detection routines looking at our (possibly animated)
          BoundingBox must take into account that collision may already be happening,
          and they must incorporate code to allow creatures/players to "get unstruck".)

        @item(Using smaller sphere also allows to naturally ascend the stairs
          and upward slopes. Sphere can move forward slightly, and then creature
          may raise up, to reach it's preferred height. Then sphere can move
          further forward, and so on. This alllows to allow stair climbing
          for creatures without any extra effort in the code.

          The downside is that creature legs will temporarily "sink into the floor"
          when climbing up the stairs. But it's not noticeable if "growing up"
          mechanism works fast enough.)
      )

      Sphere disadvantage:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(Sphere is far from perfect as a bounding volume --- it's too small,
          sometimes also too large, sometimes both at the same time...

          Since the Sphere radius remains always the same, it must be good
          for many creature animation frames. In cases where the sphere
          isn't suitable, and you don't need advantages above --- you can
          make @name return @false.
          E.g. a dead creature may be stuck in a wall,
          and it doesn't have to climb stairs. So you don't really need
          sphere advantages listed above, and @name may return @false
          when creature is in dying state.

          But still it may be a problem sometimes, if some creature states
          have entirely different animations and bounding boxes. Then you
          will be forced to choose one universal Radius for all creature
          states. And you need constant radius to keep the advantage above
          of "guarantee".

          1. Obviously you can't set radius too small, because if it's much smaller
          than actual creature's geometry then the creature will noticeably collide
          with level geometry and other creatures.

          2. On the other hand, you can't set radius too large
          (or move sphere center, Middle, much lower).
          This would block stair climbing.

          When Gravity is @true, then the @italic(bottom) is considered to be
          the plane where World.GravityCoordinate (like Z or Y axis) is zero.
          The actual bottom (lowest point) of the bounding box doesn't matter.
          This means that things placed below zero plane (like a creature tentacle
          or leg) will sink into the ground, instead of causing whole creature
          to move up. It also means that the creature can easily float above
          the ground, just model it a little above the zero plane.

          In other words, this allows you to model the creature
          with respect to the ground (zero plane), which is comfortable.

          Note that setting MiddleHeight to exact 0 means that gravity will not work,
          as it means that the PreferredHeight above the ground
          is to be stuck right at the ground level.

          For gravity to work right, the MiddleHeight should be large enough
          to cause PreferredHeight to be > @link(Sphere) radius,
          for all possible animation states (for all possible bounding box values).

        @item(
          When Gravity is @false, then the @italic(bottom) is considered

          This way it works regardless of where (0,0,0) is in your model
          (regardless if (0,0,0) represents legs, or middle of your creature),
          since we adjust to the BoundingBox position.

    { If @link(Pushes) is @true, this determines how pushing actually works.
      There two methods:

      @orderedList(
        @item(PushesEverythingInside = @true: We move every
          3D object that is inside our bounding box and has CollidesWithMoving=@true.
          This is sensible if we can reasonably assume that things
          inside our box are standing. For example if this is
          a (vertical or horizontal) elevator, then creatures/items
          are usually standing/lying inside, and naturally move with
          the same speed (and direction) as the elevator.)

        @item(When PushesEverythingInside = @false: We check precise
          collision between 3D objects with CollidesWithMoving=@true
          and our triangle mesh.
          Actually, we use T3DList.BoxCollision / T3DList.SphereCollsion,
          that will use children's T3D.BoxCollision / T3D.SphereCollsion;
          they check collisions with triangle mesh in case of TCastleScene
          with Spatial containing e.g. ssDynamicCollisions.)
      )

      Neither method is really perfect.

      PushesEverythingInside = @false seems like a more precise check,
      as it actually compares the triangle mesh, taking into account
      the interior of (this) moving 3D object. PushesEverythingInside = @true
      just approximates the moving 3D object by it's bounding box.

      On the other hand, PushesEverythingInside = @true makes the elevator
      more "sticky". With PushesEverythingInside = @false,
      when player hits the floor, it takes them some time to raise up.
      This creates a "bouncing camera" effect when the elevator goes up
      quickly: player constantly falls to the ground, tries to get up,
      but elevator moves up and player falls to it's ground again.
      When the elevator goes down, the player/creature constantly falls
      down on it because of gravity, which again causes artifacts
      as gravity may work significantly slower/faster than elavator moving speed.
      When the elevator is a horizontal moving platform, it will "slip"
      from under the player/creature, leaving the poor fella suddenly hanging
      in the air, and falling down because of gravity in the next second.

      In practice: PushesEverythingInside should be @true for small
      containers, when you can reasonably assume that things (creatures,
      player, items) stand inside, and when you intend to use it for transport
      of 3D stuff. For very large moving stuff, that possibly
      interacts with flying players/creatures in some creative way,
      PushesEverythingInside may be @false. }

    But we do take into account that other (moving) object may prefer to
    be treated as a sphere, so we take into account IsRadius, Radius parameters.
    This allows a player to climb on top of dead corpses (with flat
    bbox), since player's sphere is slightly above the ground.
    And it allows the missiles (like arrow) to use their spheres

        There is a weakness in collision checking with dynamic objects,

        from occuring (we cannot stop/reverse an arbitrary animation,

        So we must allow some moves, to allow player/creature that is already
        stuck (already collidable with Self) to get out of the collision.
        To do this, we are going to enable a move, only if *old position
        was already collidable (so the other object is stuck with us already)
        and new position is further from us (so the other object tries

    even for a short time). }

  { About List <> nil check:

    How situation with List = nil may happen? When our List is destroyed,
    it calls B.FreeNotification on all it's items, so it (falsely) seems we will
    not get any more notifications.

    It turns out that we may get notifications,
    and they are notifications about our own destruction (AComponent = Self).
    That is because TComponent.Notification passes down the notification to
    all it's FComponents, that is rtl/objpas/classes/compon.inc
    (in FPC sources) contains code

    Procedure TComponent.Notification(AComponent: TComponent; Operation: TOperation);
    begin
      ...
      For Runner:=0 To FComponents.Count-1 do
        TComponent(FComponents.Items[Runner]).Notification(AComponent,Operation);
    end;

    And FComponents contain all components that are owned.
    So we are informed when something is removed from the owner,
    including about our own removal. (And in this case, we are a T3D descendant
    ourselves, just like our children; so check "AComponent is T3D" doesn't
    protect us.)
    Practical situation when it happens is in testcases
    TTestCastle3D.TestNotifications and TTestCastle3D.TestNotificationsSceneManager. }

          But actually it's OK when Sphere is used, because then wall-sliding
          in MoveCollision can correct new position,
          so actually it will be slightly above the ground. So falling
          down will work.

          But when Sphere is not used, the situation is worse,
          because then MoveCollision doesn't do wall-sliding.
          And it will always simply reject such move
          with MaximumFallingDistance.
          If FPS is low (so we would like to fall down at once
          by large distance), this is noticeable: in such case, instead
          of falling down, creature hangs over the ground,
          because MoveCollision simply doesn't allow it fall
