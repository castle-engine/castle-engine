    @link(TCastleControl.SceneManager) for 3D world.

    This extends TOpenGLControl, adding various features:

    @unorderedList(
      @item(@link(Controls) list where you can easily add TUIControl instances
        (like TCastleOnScreenMenu, TCastleButton and more).
        We will pass events to these controls, draw them etc.)

      @item(Continously called @link(DoUpdate) method, that allows to handle
        TUIControl.Update. This is something different than LCL "idle" event,
        as it's guaranteed to be run continously, even when your application
        is clogged with events (like when using TWalkCamera.MouseLook).)

      @item(Automatically calls GLInformationInitialize
        when OpenGL context is initialized. This will initialize GLVersion,
        GLUVersion, GLFeatures.)

      @item(FPS (frames per second) counter inside @link(Fps).)

      @item(Tracks pressed keys @link(Pressed) and mouse buttons @link(MousePressed)

    { Event called when the OpenGL context is created,
      you can initialize things that require OpenGL context now.
      Often you do not need to use this callback (engine components will
      automatically create/release OpenGL resource when necessary),
      but sometimes it may be handy (e.g. TGLImage requires OpenGL context).
      You usually will also want to implement OnClose callback that
      releases stuff created here.

      Even when you really need to initialize
      some OpenGL resource (like TGLImage), instead of using this callback
      it's usually better to derive new classes from
      TUIControl class or it's descendants,
      and override their GLContextOpen / GLContextClose methods to react to
      context being open/closed. Using such TUIControl classes
      is usually easier, as you add/remove them from controls whenever
      you want (e.g. you add them in ApplicationInitialize),
      and underneath they create/release/create again the OpenGL resources
      when necessary. }
    property OnOpen: TNotifyEvent read FOnOpen write FOnOpen;

    { Event called when the context is closed, right before the OpenGL context
      is destroyed. This is your last chance to release OpenGL resources,
      like textures, shaders, display lists etc. This is a counterpart
      to OnOpen event. }
    property OnClose: TNotifyEvent read FOnClose write FOnClose;

    { Event always called right before OnRender.
      These two events, OnBeforeRender and OnRender,
      will be always called sequentially as a pair.

      The only difference between these two events is that
      time spent in OnBeforeRender
      is NOT counted as "frame time"
      by Fps.FrameTime. This is useful when you have something that needs
      to be done from time to time right before OnRender and that is very
      time-consuming. It such cases it is not desirable to put such time-consuming
      task inside OnRender because this would cause a sudden big change in
      Fps.FrameTime value. So you can avoid this by putting
      this in OnBeforeRender. }
    property OnBeforeRender: TNotifyEvent read FOnBeforeRender write FOnBeforeRender;

    { Render window contents here.

      Called when window contents must be redrawn,
      e.g. after creating a window, after resizing a window, after uncovering
      the window etc. You can also request yourself a redraw of the window
      by the Invalidate method, which will cause this event to be called
      at nearest good time.

      Note that calling Invalidate while in OnRender is not ignored.
      It means that in a short time next OnRender will be called. }
    property OnRender: TNotifyEvent read FOnRender write FOnRender;

    { Called when the control size (@code(Width), @code(Height)) changes.
      It's also guaranteed to be called
      right after the OnOpen event.

      Our OpenGL context is already "current" when this event is called
      (MakeCurrent is done right before), like for other events.
      This is a good place to set OpenGL viewport and projection matrix.

      In the usual case, the SceneManager takes care of setting appropriate
      OpenGL projection, so you don't need to do anything here. }
    property OnResize: TNotifyEvent read FOnResize write FOnResize;

    { Called when user presses a key or mouse button or moves mouse wheel. }
    property OnPress: TControlInputPressReleaseEvent read FOnPress write FOnPress;

    { Called when user releases a pressed key or mouse button.

      It's called right after @code(Pressed[Key]) changed from true to false.

      The TInputPressRelease structure, passed as a parameter to this event,
      contains the exact information what was released.

      Note that reporting characters for "key release" messages is not
      perfect, as various key combinations (sometimes more than one?) may lead
      to generating given character. We have some intelligent algorithm
      for this, used to make Characters table and to detect
      this C for OnRelease callback. The idea is that a character is released
      when the key that initially caused the press of this character is
      also released.

      This solves in a determined way problems like
      "what happens if I press Shift, then X,
      then release Shift, then release X". (will "X" be correctly
      released as pressed and then released? yes.
      will small "x" be reported as released at the end? no, as it was never
      pressed.) }
    property OnRelease: TControlInputPressReleaseEvent read FOnRelease write FOnRelease;

    { Mouse or a finger on touch device moved.

      For a mouse, remember you always have the currently
      pressed mouse buttons in MousePressed. When this is called,
      the MousePosition property records the @italic(previous)
      mouse position, while callback parameter NewMousePosition gives
      the @italic(new) mouse position. }
    property OnMotion: TControlInputMotionEvent read FOnMotion write FOnMotion;

    { Continously occuring event.
      This event is called at least as regularly as redraw,
      so it is continously called even when your game
      is overwhelmed by messages (like mouse moves) and redraws. }
    property OnUpdate: TNotifyEvent read FOnUpdate write FOnUpdate;

    { Should we automatically redraw the window all the time,
      without the need for an @link(Invalidate) call.
      If @true (the default), OnRender will called constantly.

      If your game may have a still screen (nothing animates),
      then this approach is a little unoptimal, as we use CPU and GPU
      for drawing, when it's not needed. In such case, you can set this
      property to @false, and make sure that you call
      @link(Invalidate) always when you need to redraw the screen.
      Note that the engine components always call @link(Invalidate) when
      necessary, so usually you should only call it yourself if you provide
      a custom @link(OnRender) implementation. }

    See TCastleWindow.ProcessMessage documentation about WaitToLimitFPS
    parameter, and see TCastleApplication.LimitFPS documentation.

    The mechanism does mean sleeping in your process, so it's a global
    thing, not just a property of TCastleControl.
    However, the mechanism is activated only when some TCastleControl
    component is used, and only when LCL idle is fired (so we have no pending
    events, as LCL idle is "lazy" and fires only when process is really idle),
    and not at Lazarus design time.

    When we may be clogged with events (like when using mouse look)
    this has an additional meaning:
    it is then used to force TCastleControl.DoUpdate and (if needed) repaint
    at least this often. So it is not only a limit,
    it's more like "the desired number of FPS".
    Although it's capped by MaxDesiredFPS (100), which is applied when
    LimitFPS > MaxDesiredFPS or when LimitFPS = 0 (which means "infinity"). }

      often enough (for example, you do a couple of ProcessMessage calls
      without DoLimitFPS for some reason), or when user temporarily sets
      LimitFPS to zero and then back to 100.0.
      In every case, NowTime - LastLimitFPSTime will be large, and no sleep

Reasoning: looking at implementation of OpenGLContext,
actual creating and destroying of OpenGL contexts
(i.e. calls to LOpenGLCreateContext and LOpenGLDestroyContextInfo)
is done within Create/DestroyHandle.

Why this was wrong ? Because under GTK LOpenGLCreateContext
only creates gtk_gl_area --- it doesn't *realize* it yet !
Which means that actually LOpenGLCreateContext doesn't create
OpenGL context. Looking at implementation of GLGtkGlxContext
we see that only during MakeCurrent the widget is guaranteed
to be realized. }

  { Force DoUpdate and Paint (if invalidated) events to happen,
    if sufficient time (based on LimitFPS, that in this case acts like
    "desired FPS") passed.
    This is needed when user "clogs" the GTK / WinAPI / Qt etc. event queue.
    In this case Lazarus (LCL) doesn't automatically fire the idle and repaint
    events.

    The behavior of Lazarus application Idle events is such that they
    are executed only when there are no events left to process.
    This makes sense, and actually follows the docs and the name "idle".

    In contrast, our DoUpdate expects to be run continously, that is:
    about the same number
    of times per second as the screen Redraw (and if the screen doesn't need to
    be redrawn, our DoUpdate should still run a sensible number of times
    per second --- around the same value as LimitFPS, or (when LimitFPS
    is set to 0, meaning "unused") as many times as possible).
    For our DoUpdate, it should not matter whether your event
    loop has something left to process. We need this,
    since typical games / 3D simulations must try to update animations and
    repaint at a constant rate, even when user is moving around.

    The problem is most obvious when moving the mouse, for example when using
    the mouse look to walk and look around in Walk mode (TWalkCamera.MouseLook),
    or when dragging with mouse
    in Examine mode. The event loop is then typically busy processing mouse move
    events all the time, so it's never/seldom empty (note: it doesn't mean that
    event loop is clogged, as mouse move events can be potentially accumulated
    at various levels --- LCL, underlying widgetset like GTK, underlying system
    like XWindows etc. I think in practice XWindows does it, but I'm not sure).
    Our program should however still be responsive. Not only the screen should
    be redrawn, regardless if our event loop is empty or not, but also
    our Update event should be continously called. But if we just use LCL Idle/Redraw
    behavior (that descends from other widgetsets) then you may find that:
    - during mouse look things "stutter" --- no Idle, not even Redraw,
      happens regularly.
    - during mouse drag Redraw may be regular, but still Idle are not called
      (so e.g. animations do not move, instead they suddenly jump a couple
      of seconds
      forward when you stop dragging after a couple of seconds).

    Note that TCastleWindow (with backends other than LCL) do not have this
    problem. Maybe we process events faster, so that we don't get clogged
    during MouseLook?

    We can't fix it by hacking Application methods,
    especially as LCL Application.ProcessMessage may handle a "batch"
    of events (for example, may be ~ 100 GTK messages, see
    TGtkWidgetSet.AppProcessMessages in lazarus/trunk/lcl/interfaces/gtk/gtkwidgetset.inc).
    So instead we hack it from the inside: from time to time
    (more precisely, LimitFPS times per second),
    when receving an often occuring event (right now: just MouseMove),
    we'll call the DoUpdate, and (if pending Invalidate call) Paint methods.

    In theory, we could call this on every event (key down, mouse down etc.).
    But in practice:
    - Doing this from KeyDown would make redraw when moving by only holding
      down some keys stutter a little (screen seems like not refreshed fast
      enough). Reason for this stutter is not known,
      it also stutters in case of mouse move, but we have no choice in this case:
      either update with stuttering, or not update (continously) at all.
      TCastleWindow doesn't have this problem, mouse look is smooth there.
    - It's also not needed from events other than mouse move.

    In theory, for LimitFPS = 0, we should just do this every time.
    But this would overload the system
    (you would see smooth animation and rendering, but there will be latency
    with respect to handling input, e.g. mouse move will be processed with
    a small delay). So we use MaxDesiredFPS to cap it. }
