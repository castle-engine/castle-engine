  { "View" represents the current state of your application user interface.
    See also https://castle-engine.io/views
    for an overview of using TCastleView.

    In a given container (like a window), in the simple case only one TCastleView is @italic(current) at a given time,
    and it can be get or set using the @link(TCastleContainer.View) property.
    In more complex cases, you can use @link(TCastleContainer.PushView) and @link(TCastleContainer.PopView)
    to build a stack of views, and in effect multiple views are active at the same time.
    All of the views on stack are @italic(started), but only the top-most is @italic(resumed).

    Each TCastleView has @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
    methods that you can override to perform work when view becomes
    part of the current view stack, or stops being part of it.

    You can also override @link(Resume) and @link(Pause) methods,
    to perform work when the view becomes the top-most view or is no longer
    the top-most view. The distinction becomes important once you play
    around with pushing/popping view.

    To define view user interface:

    @orderedList(
      @item(It is simplest to set @link(DesignUrl)
        to the design file you created using @url(https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php CGE editor).
        Such user interface controls will be created right before @link(Start)
        and destroyed right after @link(Stop) (so the view UI always "resets"
        when view starts).)

      @item(You can always create more UI controls and add them to the view at any point.
        The view is a @link(TCastleUserInterface) descendant and you can add UI to it
        just by using @link(TCastleUserInterface.InsertFront).

        UI children can be added anytime you want, e.g. in @link(Start) or in overridden
        constructor.

        UI children can be removed or destroyed anytime you want as well.
        You can use @link(FreeAtStop) as an owner for anything you want to be automatically
        destroyed at @link(Stop).)
    )

    Current view is placed on the list of container controls.
    This way view is notified about UI events, and can react to them.
    Note that our children will handle events @italic(before) the view itself
    is notified about them, following @link(TCastleUserInterface) events behavior.
    This way view can:

    @unorderedList(
      @item(React to @link(TCastleUserInterface.Press Press),
        @link(TCastleUserInterface.Release Release) of keys or mouse buttons,)

      @item(do something continuos in @link(TCastleUserInterface.Update Update).)
    )

    override in your view descendants to capture various events. }

    { Container in which view is started (if view is started)
      or on which we predict it will be started (if view is not started yet).

      If view is not started yet,
      this is
      @link(TCastleApplication.MainWindow Application.MainWindow)
      if you use CastleWindow or
      @link(TCastleControl.MainControl) if you use CastleControl.

      When the view has started, then @link(Container) property (from
      ancestor, see TCastleUserInterface.Container) is equal to this. }
    function PredictedContainer: TCastleContainer;
  protected
    { The container size is always known: we assume that view will be part
      of GetMainContainer, if the view not yet started.

      So the view knows container size, regardless if we are between Start / Stop,
      regardless if the TCastleView is already added to some TCastleContainer.Children.
      This makes all other routines, like ParentRect, EffectiveRect, EffectiveWidth,
      EffectiveHeight also work. }
    function ContainerWidth: Cardinal; override;
    function ContainerHeight: Cardinal; override;
    function ContainerRect: TRectangle; override;
    function ContainerSizeKnown: boolean; override;

    function StateContainer: TCastleContainer; deprecated 'use Container to get the container in which we are already started, use GetMainContainer to get global central container';

    { The container in which the view works.

      This is just like @link(Container) property (from
      ancestor, see TCastleUserInterface.Container) but it is
      already assigned even during @link(Start) and @link(Stop).

      This method @italic(deliberately hides the ancestor @link(TCastleUserInterface.Container)
      method).
      This way it will work always, in particular also during @link(Start) method.
      This allows you to do code like this in overridden @link(Start) method:

      @longCode(# Container.OverrideCursor := mcNone; #) }
    function Container: TCastleContainer;

    { Assign this component as owner for your controls,
      to make them freed right after nearest @link(Stop).

      This component is created on-demand (whenever you access it)
      and always destroyed right after running view @link(Stop) method.

      The idea is that you can assign it as @italic(owner) (1st parameter to the constructor
      of @code(TComponent) class or any classes descending from @code(TComponent),
      this includes all CGE components) of something, like this:

      @longCode(#
        MyInstance := TSomeComponent.Create(FreeAtStop);
      #)

      And in effect, you know that @code(MyInstance) will be freed after the view stops.
      So you don't need to worry about it anymore, in particular you don't need to do
      @code(FreeAndNil(MyInstance)) in the state @link(Stop). }
    function FreeAtStop: TComponent;
  public
    { When @true, view operations will send a log to CastleLog. }
    class var Log: boolean;

    { Create an instance of the view.
      You willl typically create one instance of each view class
      (like TViewMain, TViewPlay) at the application initialization
      (e.g. in Application.OnInitialize callback), like

      @longCode(#
        ViewMainMenu := TViewMainMenu.Create(Application);
        ViewPlay := TViewPlay.Create(Application);
      #)

      Later you switch between views using @link(TCastleContainer.View) or
      @link(TCastleContainer.PushView) or
      @link(TCastleContainer.PopView),
      like this:

      @longCode(#
        Container.View := ViewMain;
      #)

      See https://castle-engine.io/views and numerous engine examples.
    }
    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;
    destructor Destroy; override;

    { Create the instance TCastleView that will be automatically freed when
      the view is stopped.
      This allows alternative usage of views (as opposed to the ones described in @link(Create)
      docs), where you create short-lived instances of view classes.
      Use it like this:

      @longCode(#
        Container.View := TViewMain.CreateUntilStopped;
      #)

      The advantages:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(You don't need to worry
          that some view field value will "survive" with an invalid value after
          @link(Stop). So you don't need to clear everything in @link(Stop)
          or initialize everything in @link(Start), instead you can depend
          that @link(Start) happens only once right after the constructor,
          so the instance fields are clear.)

        @item(You avoid having global variables, keeping singletons of each view class.
          So the code is a little safer.)

        @item(You can reintroduce your own constructor to require some parameters,
          instead of exposing view parameters as public fields/properties.)
      )

      The disadvantage is that you cannot store in view fields anything
      that should "survive" the view @link(Stop).
      You can instead use "class variables" in view class, or any global variable.
    }
    constructor CreateUntilStopped;

    { Executed when view becomes active, it's now part of the view stack.

      Started view is part of the ViewStack, and will soon become
      running (top-most on the stack). When the view is set to be current,
      by @code(Container.View := MyView), this happens:

      @orderedList(
        @item(MyView is pushed as the top-most view on view stack.)
        @item(MyView.Start is called.)
        @item(MyView is added to the @link(TCastleContainer.Controls) list
          (using the container where you set @link(TCastleContainer.PushView),
          @link(TCastleContainer.View)).
          This also means that the view methods GLContextOpen and Resize are called
          (as for all normal TCastleUserInterface instances).)
        @item(MyStar.Resume is called.)
      ) }
    procedure Start; virtual;

    { Executed when view is no longer active, no longer part of view stack.

      When the view stops becoming active, this happens:

      @orderedList(
        @item(MyView.Pause is called.)
        @item(MyView is removed from the
          @code(TCastleContainer.Controls) list
          (using the container to which we were added).
          So the view method GLContextClose is called
          (as for all normal TCastleUserInterface instances).)
        @item(MyView.Stop is called.)
        @item(MyView is removed from the on view stack.)
      )

      This is always called to finalize the started view.
      When the view is destroyed, it's @link(Pause) and @link(Stop)
      are called too, so you can use this method to reliably finalize whatever
      you initialized in @link(Start). }
    procedure Stop; virtual;

    { Executed when view is now the top-most view. See @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
      docs about view lifecycle methods.
      This is called after @link(Start), it is also called
      when you pop another view, making this view the top-most. }
    procedure Resume; virtual;

    { Executed when view is no longer the top-most view. See @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
      docs about view lifecycle methods.
      This is called before @link(Stop), it is also called
      when another view is pushed over this view, so this stops
      being the the top-most view. }
    procedure Pause; virtual;

    procedure Finish; virtual; deprecated 'use Stop';

    { View is right now part of the view stack, which means
      it's between @link(Start) and @link(Stop) calls.
      The view is added to the stack before the @link(Start) call,
      and removed after the @link(Stop) call, so this returns @true
      during all the methods --- @link(Start), @link(Resume), @link(Pause), @link(Stop). }
    function Active: boolean;

    { Prevents passing mouse/keyboard events to the UI views underneath.

      More precisely, when this property is @true, then the
      @link(Press), @link(Release) and @link(Motion) events are marked as
      "handled" in this UI view. This means that they will not be processed
      further, by UI controls under this view, in particular by UI views
      that are underneath this view in @italic(view stack) (created
      by @link(Push) method). They will also not be passed to final container
      (TCastleWindow, TCastleControl) callbacks like
      TCastleWindow.OnPress (as these callbacks are always used at the end,
      when nothing else handled the event).

      Note that setting this to @true means that calling @code(inherited)
      from your @link(Press) overridden implementation will always return @true,
      as if the ancestor handled all the items. For this reason,
      in such case you should not immediately Exit when @code(inherited) is @true.
      You should just ignore the ancestor result, like this:

      @longCode(#
      function TMyView.Press(const Event: TInputPressRelease): Boolean;
      begin
        Result := inherited;
        // ignore the ancestor result, as we use InterceptInput, so ancestor always returns true
        // if Result the Exit;

        if Event.IsMouseButton(buttonLeft) then
        begin
          ...
          Exit(true);
        end;
      end;

    { Load and show a user interface from a .castle-user-interface file,
      designed in Castle Game Engine Editor.

      This is an utility method, loading a UI in a typical way into the TCastleView.
      It is not the only way to load a .castle-user-interface file,
      a more general approach is to use @link(UserInterfaceLoad) from
      @link(CastleComponentSerialize) unit, and manually call InsertFront
      to add it to the view UI.

      The loaded UI is returned under the @code(Ui) parameter,
      unless you use an overloaded version that omits this parameter.

      It is owned by @code(UiOwner), which is useful to find the components
      by name, like
      @longCode(#
        ButtonQuit := UiOwner.FindRequiredComponent('ButtonQuit') as TCastleButton;
      #)

      The UiOwner, in turn, is owned by the FinalOwner.
      You typically use this method inside overridden @link(Start),
      and as FinalOwner you pass @link(FreeAtStop) -- this way the user interface
      is freed when the view is stopped.
    }
    procedure InsertUserInterface(const ADesignUrl: String;
      const FinalOwner: TComponent;
      out Ui: TCastleUserInterface; out UiOwner: TComponent); overload; deprecated 'instead of this, set DesignUrl in constructor';
    procedure InsertUserInterface(const ADesignUrl: String;
      const FinalOwner: TComponent; out UiOwner: TComponent); overload; deprecated 'instead of this, set DesignUrl in constructor';

    { Wait until the render event happens (to redraw current view),
      and then call Event.

      The scheduled Event will be called at the @link(Update) time.

      If the view stopped before the scheduled events fired,
      then the remaining events are ignored.
      That is, the scheduled events are cleared every time you start the view.

      One use-case of this is to show a loading view,
      where you load things, but also update the loading progress from time to time.
      Be careful in this case to not call this @italic(too often),
      as then your loading time will be tied to rendering time.
      For example, when the monitor refresh rate is 60, and the "vertical sync"
      is "on", then the render events happen at most 60 times per second.
      So if you call WaitForRenderAndCall too often during loading,
      you may spend more time waiting for render event (each WaitForRenderAndCall
      taking 1/60 of second) than doing actual loading. }
    procedure WaitForRenderAndCall(const Event: TNotifyEvent);

    { Load a designed user interface (from .castle-user-interface file)
      when this view is started.
      You typically set this property in overridden constructor, and in effect
      the given design file will be loaded right before @link(Start) and it will be freed
      right after @link(Stop).

      Typical use-case looks like this:

      @longCode(#
      constructor TViewPlay.Create(AOwner: TComponent);
      begin
        inherited;
        DesignUrl := 'castle-data:/gameviewplay.castle-user-interface';
        // DesignPreload := true; // to make future "Container.View := ViewPlay" faster
      end;
      #)

      The published fields of this class,
      if they have equal name to any component in the design,
      are automatically initialized to the instance of this component.
      (And they will be set to @nil when the design is destroyed, typically at @link(Stop).)

      You can also modify this property when the view has already started
      (after @link(Start) and before @link(Stop)) in which case
      the previous design will be freed and new one will be loaded immediately.

      Set this to empty string (default) to mean "no design should be loaded".

      Note that this is not the only way to load a .castle-user-interface file.
      A more general approach is to use @link(UserInterfaceLoad),
      and call @link(InsertFront) to add it to the view UI.
      Using this property just adds some comfortable automatic behavior
      (design is freed at stop, published fields of view are set,
      you can use comfortable @link(DesignPreload)).

      @seealso DesignPreload
    }
    property DesignUrl: String read FDesignUrl write SetDesignUrl;

    { Preload the design file (specified in @link(DesignUrl)) as soon as possible,
      making starting the view much faster.
      Using this property means that we "preload" the design file,
      to cache the referenced images / TCastleScene instances etc. as soon as possible,
      to make the future loading of this design (when view starts) very quick.

      Typically you set this property in overridden TCastleView constructor,
      right after (or before, it doesn't matter) setting DesignUrl.
      It will mean that constructor takes a longer time (which typically means
      that Application.OnInitialize takes a longer time) but in exchange
      future starting of the view (when you do e.g. @code(Container.View := ViewXxx)
      or @code(Container.PushView(ViewXxx)) will be much faster.

      No functional difference should be visible, regardless of the @link(DesignPreload)
      value. Internally the designed component is added/removed from view at the same time.
      So think of this property as pure optimization -- you decide whether to slow down
      the view constructor, or view start.

      @seealso DesignUrl }
    property DesignPreload: Boolean read FDesignPreload write SetDesignPreload default false;

    { When the DesignUrl is set, and the view is started, you can use this method to find
      loaded components. Like this:

      @longCode(#
      MyButton := DesignedComponent('MyButton') as TCastleButton;
      #)

      This method is seldom useful now.
      The published fields of the view are automatically initialized when
      loading / unloading design using @link(DesignUrl).
      There's no need to use DesignedComponent for them.
