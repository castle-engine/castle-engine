  { UI state, to manage the state of your game UI.
    See also https://castle-engine.io/states
    for an overview of using TUIState.

    In simple cases, only one state is @italic(current) at a given time,
    and it can be get or set using the @link(TUIState.Current) property.
    In more complex cases, you can use @link(TUIState.Push) and @link(TUIState.Pop)
    to build a stack of states, and in effect multiple states are active at the same time.
    All of the states on stack are @italic(started), but only the top-most is @italic(resumed).

    Each state has @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
    methods that you can override to perform work when state becomes
    part of the current state stack, or stops being part of it.
    You can also override @link(Resume) and @link(Pause) methods,
    to perform work when the state becomes the top-most state or is no longer
    the top-most state. The distinction becomes important once you play
    around with pushing/popping states.

    To define state user interface:

    @orderedList(
      @item(It is simplest to set @link(DesignUrl)
        to the design file you created using @url(https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php CGE editor).
        Such user interface controls will be created right before @link(Start)
        and destroyed right after @link(Stop) (so the state UI always "resets"
        when state starts).)

      @item(You can always create more UI controls and add them to the state at any point.
        The state is a @link(TCastleUserInterface) descendant and you can add UI to it
        just by using @link(TCastleUserInterface.InsertFront).

        UI children can be added anytime you want, e.g. in @link(Start) or in overridden
        constructor.

        UI children can be removed or destroyed anytime you want as well.
        You can use @link(FreeAtStop) as an owner for anything you want to be automatically
        destroyed at @link(Stop).)
    )

    Current state is placed on the list of container controls.
    This way state is notified about UI events, and can react to them.
    Note that our children will handle events @italic(before) the state itself
    is notified about them, following @link(TCastleUserInterface) events behavior.
    This way state can:

    @unorderedList(
      @item(React to @link(TCastleUserInterface.Press Press),
        @link(TCastleUserInterface.Release Release) of keys or mouse buttons,)

      @item(do something continuos in @link(TCastleUserInterface.Update Update).)
    )

    See the TCastleUserInterface class for a lot of useful methods that you can
    override in your state descendants to capture various events. }

    { Current state. Simply assign to this property to change the current state.

      In case multiple states are active (only possible
      if you used the @link(Push) method), this property returns the @italic(bottom) state
      (use @link(CurrentTop) to get @italic(top) state).
      Setting this property resets whole state stack.

      @bold(When is it allowed to change the state?)

      While in theory you can change current state stack (assigning @link(TUIState.Current)
      or using @link(TUIState.Push) / @link(TUIState.Pop)) at any moment,
      but remember that stopping the state frees also the state UI.
      So you should not change the current state stack within events/overriden methods
      of classes like TCastleUserInterface, TCastleTransform, TCastleBehavior
      that could be destroyed by the state stop.

      The simpler advise is: @italic(Assign to @link(TUIState.Current) or use @link(TUIState.Push) / @link(TUIState.Pop)
      only from the overridden TUIState methods.
      Like TMyState.Update or TMyState.Press).

      Note that you cannot change current state stack when another change is in progress.
      That is, you cannot change state from within TMyState.Start/Resume/Pause/Stop.

    { The top-most state.

      In case you used @link(Push), this returns the top-most (most recently pushed) state.

      If there is only one (or none) state, e.g. because you never used @link(Push),
      then this property returns the same thing as @link(Current). }
    class property CurrentTop: TUIState read GetCurrentTop;

    { Pushing the state adds it at the top of the state stack,
      this makes new state to be displayed on top of previous ones.

      The state known as @link(Current) is conceptually at the bottom of state stack, always.
      When it is nil, then pushing new state sets the @link(Current) state.
      Otherwise @link(Current) state is left as-it-is, new state is added on top. }

      also checking whether the current top-most state is as expected.

      Makes a warning, and does nothing, if the current top-most state
      is different than indicated. This is usually a safer (more chance
      to easily catch bugs) version of Pop than the parameter-less version. }

    class property StateStack [const Index: Integer]: TUIState read GetStateStack;

    { Create an instance of the state.
      You willl typically create one instance of each state class
      (like TStateMain, TStatePlay) at the application initialization
      (e.g. in Application.OnInitialize callback), like

      @longCode(#
        StateMainMenu := TStateMainMenu.Create(Application);
        StatePlay := TStatePlay.Create(Application);
      #)

      Later you switch between states using @link(Current) or @link(Push) or @link(Pop),
      like this:

      @longCode(#
        TUIState.Current := StateMain;
      #)

      See https://castle-engine.io/states and numerous engine examples.
    }
    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;
    destructor Destroy; override;

    { Create the instance TUIState that will be automatically freed when
      the state is stopped.
      This allows alternative usage of states (as opposed to the ones described in @link(Create)
      docs), where you create short-lived instances of state classes.
      Use it like this:

      @longCode(#
        TUIState.Current := TStateMain.CreateUntilStopped;
      #)

      The advantages:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(You don't need to worry
          that some state field value will "survive" with an invalid value after
          @link(Stop). So you don't need to clear everything in @link(Stop)
          or initialize everything in @link(Start), instead you can depend
          that @link(Start) happens only once right after the constructor,
          so the instance fields are clear.)

        @item(You avoid having global variables, keeping singletons of each state class.
          So the code is a little safer.)

        @item(You can reintroduce your own constructor to require some parameters,
          instead of exposing state parameters as public fields/properties.)
      )

      The disadvantage is that you cannot store in state fields anything
      that should "survive" the state @link(Stop).
      You can instead use "class variables" in state class, or any global variable.
    }
    constructor CreateUntilStopped;

    { Executed when state becomes active, it's now part of the state stack.

      Started state is part of the StateStack, and will soon become
      running (top-most on the stack). When the state is set to be current,
      by @code(TUIState.Current := MyState), this happens:

      @orderedList(
        @item(MyState is pushed as the top-most state on state stack.)
        @item(MyState.Start is called.)
        @item(MyState is added to the @code(StateContainer.Controls) list,
          so the state methods GLContextOpen and Resize are called
          (as for all normal TCastleUserInterface instances).)
        @item(MyStar.Resume is called.)
      ) }
    procedure Start; virtual;

    { Executed when state is no longer active, no longer part of state stack.

      When the state stops becoming active, this happens:

      @orderedList(
        @item(MyState.Pause is called.)
        @item(MyState is removed from the
          @code(StateContainer.Controls) list.
          So the state method GLContextClose is called
          (as for all normal TCastleUserInterface instances).)
        @item(MyState.Stop is called.)
        @item(MyState is removed from the on state stack.)
      )

      This is always called to finalize the started state.
      When the state is destroyed, it's @link(Pause) and @link(Stop)
      are called too, so you can use this method to reliably finalize whatever
      you initialized in @link(Start). }
    procedure Stop; virtual;

    { Executed when state is now the top-most state. See @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
      docs about state lifecycle methods.
      This is called after @link(Start), it is also called
      when you pop another state, making this state the top-most. }
    procedure Resume; virtual;

    { Executed when state is no longer the top-most state. See @link(Start) and @link(Stop)
      docs about state lifecycle methods.
      This is called before @link(Stop), it is also called
      when another state is pushed over this state, so this stops
      being the the top-most state. }
    procedure Pause; virtual;

    procedure Finish; virtual; deprecated 'use Stop';

    { State is right now part of the state stack, which means
      it's between @link(Start) and @link(Stop) calls.
      The state is added to the stack before the @link(Start) call,
      and removed after the @link(Stop) call, so this returns @true
      during all the methods --- @link(Start), @link(Resume), @link(Pause), @link(Stop). }
    function Active: boolean;

    { Prevents passing mouse/keyboard events to the states underneath.

      More precisely, when this property is @true, then the
      @link(Press), @link(Release) and @link(Motion) events are marked as
      "handled" in this UI state. This means that they will not be processed
      further, by UI controls under this state, in particular by UI states
      that are underneath this state in @italic(state stack) (created
      by @link(Push) method). They will also not be passed to final container
      (TCastleWindow, TCastleControl) callbacks like
      TCastleWindow.OnPress (as these callbacks are always used at the end,
      when nothing else handled the event).

      Note that setting this to @true means that calling @code(inherited)
      from your @link(Press) overridden implementation will always return @true,
      as if the ancestor handled all the items. For this reason,
      in such case you should not immediately Exit when @code(inherited) is @true.
      You should just ignore the ancestor result, like this:

      @longCode(#
      function TMyState.Press(const Event: TInputPressRelease): Boolean;
      begin
        Result := inherited;
        // ignore the ancestor result, as we use InterceptInput, so ancestor always returns true
        // if Result the Exit;

        if Event.IsMouseButton(buttonLeft) then
        begin
          ...
          Exit(true);
        end;
      end;
      #)
    }
    property InterceptInput: boolean read FInterceptInput write FInterceptInput
      default false;

    { Load and show a user interface from a .castle-user-interface file,
      designed in Castle Game Engine Editor.

      This is an utility method, loading a UI in a typical way into the TUIState.
      It is not the only way to load a .castle-user-interface file,
      a more general approach is to use @link(UserInterfaceLoad) from
      @link(CastleComponentSerialize) unit, and manually call InsertFront
      to add it to the state UI.

      The loaded UI is returned under the @code(Ui) parameter,
      unless you use an overloaded version that omits this parameter.

      It is owned by @code(UiOwner), which is useful to find the components
      by name, like
      @longCode(#
        ButtonQuit := UiOwner.FindRequiredComponent('ButtonQuit') as TCastleButton;
      #)

      The UiOwner, in turn, is owned by the FinalOwner.
      You typically use this method inside overridden @link(Start),
      and as FinalOwner you pass @link(FreeAtStop) -- this way the user interface
      is freed when the state is stopped.
    }
    procedure InsertUserInterface(const ADesignUrl: String;
      const FinalOwner: TComponent;
      out Ui: TCastleUserInterface; out UiOwner: TComponent); overload; deprecated 'instead of this, set DesignUrl in constructor';
    procedure InsertUserInterface(const ADesignUrl: String;
      const FinalOwner: TComponent; out UiOwner: TComponent); overload; deprecated 'instead of this, set DesignUrl in constructor';

    { Wait until the render event happens (to redraw current state),
      and then call Event.

      The scheduled Event will be called at the @link(Update) time.

      If the state stopped before the scheduled events fired,
      then the remaining events are ignored.
      That is, the scheduled events are cleared every time you start the state.

      One use-case of this is to show a loading state,
      where you load things, but also update the loading progress from time to time.
      Be careful in this case to not call this @italic(too often),
      as then your loading time will be tied to rendering time.
      For example, when the monitor refresh rate is 60, and the "vertical sync"
      is "on", then the render events happen at most 60 times per second.
      So if you call WaitForRenderAndCall too often during loading,
      you may spend more time waiting for render event (each WaitForRenderAndCall
      taking 1/60 of second) than doing actual loading. }
    procedure WaitForRenderAndCall(const Event: TNotifyEvent);

    { Load a designed user interface (from .castle-user-interface file)
      when this state is started.
      You typically set this property in overridden constructor, and in effect
      the given design file will be loaded right before @link(Start) and it will be freed
      right after @link(Stop).

      Typical use-case looks like this:

      @longCode(#
      constructor TStatePlay.Create(AOwner: TComponent);
      begin
        inherited;
        DesignUrl := 'castle-data:/gamestateplay.castle-user-interface';
        // DesignPreload := true; // to make future "TUIState.Current := StatePlay" faster
      end;
      #)

      The published fields of this class,
      if they have equal name to any component in the design,
      are automatically initialized to the instance of this component.
      (And they will be set to @nil when the design is destroyed, typically at @link(Stop).)

      You can also modify this property when the state has already started
      (after @link(Start) and before @link(Stop)) in which case
      the previous design will be freed and new one will be loaded immediately.

      Set this to empty string (default) to mean "no design should be loaded".

      Note that this is not the only way to load a .castle-user-interface file.
      A more general approach is to use @link(UserInterfaceLoad),
      and call @link(InsertFront) to add it to the state UI.
      Using this property just adds some comfortable automatic behavior
      (state is freed at stop, published fields of state are set,
      you can use comfortable @link(DesignPreload)).

      @seealso DesignPreload
    }
    property DesignUrl: String read FDesignUrl write SetDesignUrl;

    { Preload the design file (specified in @link(DesignUrl)) as soon as possible,
      making starting the state much faster.
      Using this property means that we "preload" the design file,
      to cache the referenced images / TCastleScene instances etc. as soon as possible,
      to make the future loading of this design (when state starts) very quick.

      Typically you set this property in overridden TUIState constructor,
      right after (or before, it doesn't matter) setting DesignUrl.
      It will mean that constructor takes a longer time (which typically means
      that Application.OnInitialize takes a longer time) but in exchange
      future starting of the state (when you do e.g. @code(TUIState.Current := StateXxx)
      or @code(TUIState.Push(StateXxx)) will be much faster.

      No functional difference should be visible, regardless of the @link(DesignPreload)
      value. Internally the designed component is added/removed from state at the same time.
      So think of this property as pure optimization -- you decide whether to slow down
      the state constructor, or state start.

      #)

      This method is seldom useful now.
      The published fields of the state are automatically initialized when
      loading / unloading design using @link(DesignUrl).
      There's no need to use DesignedComponent for them.
