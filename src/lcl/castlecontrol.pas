{ Define to use a timer (with Interval = 1) to update the control.
  If not defined, we will use Application.AddOnIdleHandler.
  Unfortunately there's no perfect solution:

  - Using Application.AddOnIdleHandler means that we need to install
    idle handler that always sets "Done := false" (to prevent Lazarus
    TApplication.Idle from doing WidgetSet.AppWaitMessage
    in lazarus/lcl/include/application.inc ).

    Disadvantages:

    This approach blocks events registered later by Application.AddOnIdleHandler
    from working. (because the first idle event with "Done := false" breaks
    execution of idle events.)
    This hurts in case you have other components using
    LCL Application.AddOnIdleHandler.

    We also should not do it at design-time in Lazarus IDE
    (so e.g. TCastleControl cannot play animations at design-time in Lazarus IDE).

    If you want to reliably do some continuous work, use Castle Game Engine
    features to do it. There are various alternative ways:

    - Register an event on @link(OnUpdate) of this component,

    - Add custom @link(TCastleUserInterface) instance to the @link(Controls) list
      with overridden @link(TCastleUserInterface.Update) method,)

    - Register an event on @link(TCastleApplicationProperties.OnUpdate
      ApplicationProperties.OnUpdate) from the @link(CastleApplicationProperties)
      unit.

    The advantage of Application.AddOnIdleHandler is that it always works,
    it reliably prevents LCL from calling WidgetSet.AppWaitMessage that hangs
    indefinitely long.

  - Using timer means that we don't have to define idle handler.

    This removes problems of idle:
    We don't block other idle handlers (or timers).
    We can animate at design-time in Lazarus IDE.

    Disadvantage: It simply doesn't work with GTK widgetset.
    The timer execution doesn't break the WidgetSet.AppWaitMessage
    on GTK, and so timer with Interval=1 can in fact hang for an arbitrarily
    long time if you don't make any event (like mouse movement).

    Use their events like @link(TCastleUserInterface.OnPress) to react to input.
    Use event @link(TCastleUserInterface.OnUpdate) to do something continuously.

    @link(TCastleContainer.BackgroundColor Container.BackgroundColor).

    { Force DoUpdate and Paint (if invalidated) events to happen,
      if sufficient time (based on LimitFPS, that in this case acts like
      "desired FPS") passed.
      This is needed when user "clogs" the GTK / WinAPI / Qt etc. event queue.
      In this case Lazarus (LCL) doesn't automatically fire the idle and repaint
      events.

      The behavior of Lazarus application Idle events is such that they
      are executed only when there are no events left to process.
      This makes sense, and actually follows the docs and the name "idle".

      In contrast, our DoUpdate expects to be run continuously, that is:
      about the same number
      of times per second as the screen Redraw (and if the screen doesn't need to
      be redrawn, our DoUpdate should still run a sensible number of times
      per second --- around the same value as LimitFPS, or (when LimitFPS
      is set to 0, meaning "unused") as many times as possible).
      For our DoUpdate, it should not matter whether your event
      loop has something left to process. We need this,
      since typical games / 3D simulations must try to update animations and
      repaint at a constant rate, even when user is moving around.

      The problem is most obvious when moving the mouse, for example when using
      the mouse look to walk and look around in Walk mode (TCastleWalkNavigation.MouseLook),
      or when dragging with mouse
      in Examine mode. The event loop is then typically busy processing mouse move
      events all the time, so it's never/seldom empty (note: it doesn't mean that
      event loop is clogged, as mouse move events can be potentially accumulated
      at various levels --- LCL, underlying widgetset like GTK, underlying system
      like XWindows etc. I think in practice XWindows does it, but I'm not sure).
      Our program should however still be responsive. Not only the screen should
      be redrawn, regardless if our event loop is empty or not, but also
      our Update event should be continuously called. But if we just use LCL Idle/Redraw
      behavior (that descends from other widgetsets) then you may find that:
      - during mouse look things "stutter" --- no Idle, not even Redraw,
        happens regularly.
      - during mouse drag Redraw may be regular, but still Idle are not called
        (so e.g. animations do not move, instead they suddenly jump a couple
        of seconds
        forward when you stop dragging after a couple of seconds).

      Note that TCastleWindow (with backends other than LCL) do not have this
      problem. Maybe we process events faster, so that we don't get clogged
      during MouseLook?

      We can't fix it by hacking Application methods,
      especially as LCL Application.ProcessMessage may handle a "batch"
      of events (for example, may be ~ 100 GTK messages, see
      TGtkWidgetSet.AppProcessMessages in lazarus/trunk/lcl/interfaces/gtk/gtkwidgetset.inc).
      So instead we hack it from the inside: from time to time
      (more precisely, LimitFPS times per second),
      when receving an often occuring event (right now: just MouseMove),
      we'll call the DoUpdate, and (if pending Invalidate call) Paint methods.

      In theory, we could call this on every event (key down, mouse down etc.).
      But in practice:
      - Doing this from KeyDown would make redraw when moving by only holding
        down some keys stutter a little (screen seems like not refreshed fast
        enough). Reason for this stutter is not known,
        it also stutters in case of mouse move, but we have no choice in this case:
        either update with stuttering, or not update (continuously) at all.
        TCastleWindow doesn't have this problem, mouse look is smooth there.
      - It's also not needed from events other than mouse move.

      In theory, for LimitFPS = 0, we should just do this every time.
      But this would overload the system
      (you would see smooth animation and rendering, but there will be latency
      with respect to handling input, e.g. mouse move will be processed with
      a small delay). So we use MaxDesiredFPS to cap it. }

    Reasoning: looking at implementation of OpenGLContext,
    actual creating and destroying of OpenGL contexts
    (i.e. calls to LOpenGLCreateContext and LOpenGLDestroyContextInfo)
    is done within Create/DestroyHandle.

    But this was wrong. Under GTK LOpenGLCreateContext
    only creates gtk_gl_area --- it doesn't *realize* it.
    Which means that actually LOpenGLCreateContext doesn't create
    OpenGL context. Looking at implementation of GLGtkGlxContext
    we see that only during MakeCurrent the widget is guaranteed
    to be realized.

    FBO are not shared in new OpenGL versions, see
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4385655/is-it-possible-to-share-an-opengl-framebuffer-object-between-contexts-threads
