{ Define to use a timer (with Interval = 1) to update the control.
  If not defined, we will use Application.AddOnIdleHandler.
  Unfortunately there's no perfect solution:

  - Using Application.AddOnIdleHandler means that we need to install
    idle handler that always sets "Done := false" (to prevent Lazarus
    TApplication.Idle from doing WidgetSet.AppWaitMessage
    in lazarus/lcl/include/application.inc ).

    Disadvantages:

    This approach blocks events registered later by Application.AddOnIdleHandler
    from working. (because the first idle event with "Done := false" breaks
    execution of idle events.)
    This hurts in case you have other components using
    LCL Application.AddOnIdleHandler.

    We also should not do it at design-time in Lazarus IDE
    (so e.g. TCastleControl cannot play animations at design-time in Lazarus IDE).

    If you want to reliably do some continuous work, use Castle Game Engine
    features to do it. There are various alternative ways:

    - Register an event on @link(OnUpdate) of this component,

    - Add custom @link(TCastleUserInterface) instance to the @link(Controls) list
      with overridden @link(TCastleUserInterface.Update) method,)

    - Register an event on @link(TCastleApplicationProperties.OnUpdate
      ApplicationProperties.OnUpdate) from the @link(CastleApplicationProperties)
      unit.

    The advantage of Application.AddOnIdleHandler is that it always works,
    it reliably prevents LCL from calling WidgetSet.AppWaitMessage that hangs
    indefinitely long.

  - Using timer means that we don't have to define idle handler.

    This removes problems of idle:
    We don't block other idle handlers (or timers).
    We can animate at design-time in Lazarus IDE.

    Disadvantage: It simply doesn't work with GTK widgetset.
    The timer execution doesn't break the WidgetSet.AppWaitMessage
    on GTK, and so timer with Interval=1 can in fact hang for an arbitrarily
    long time if you don't make any event (like mouse movement).

    { Force DoUpdate and Paint (if invalidated) events to happen,
      if sufficient time (based on LimitFPS, that in this case acts like
      "desired FPS") passed.
      This is needed when user "clogs" the GTK / WinAPI / Qt etc. event queue.
      In this case Lazarus (LCL) doesn't automatically fire the idle and repaint
      events.

      The behavior of Lazarus application Idle events is such that they
      are executed only when there are no events left to process.
      This makes sense, and actually follows the docs and the name "idle".

      In contrast, our DoUpdate expects to be run continuously, that is:
      about the same number
      of times per second as the screen Redraw (and if the screen doesn't need to
      be redrawn, our DoUpdate should still run a sensible number of times
      per second --- around the same value as LimitFPS, or (when LimitFPS
      is set to 0, meaning "unused") as many times as possible).
      For our DoUpdate, it should not matter whether your event
      loop has something left to process. We need this,
      since typical games / 3D simulations must try to update animations and
      repaint at a constant rate, even when user is moving around.

      The problem is most obvious when moving the mouse, for example when using
      the mouse look to walk and look around in Walk mode (TCastleWalkNavigation.MouseLook),
      or when dragging with mouse
      in Examine mode. The event loop is then typically busy processing mouse move
      events all the time, so it's never/seldom empty (note: it doesn't mean that
      event loop is clogged, as mouse move events can be potentially accumulated
      at various levels --- LCL, underlying widgetset like GTK, underlying system
      like XWindows etc. I think in practice XWindows does it, but I'm not sure).
      Our program should however still be responsive. Not only the screen should
      be redrawn, regardless if our event loop is empty or not, but also
      our Update event should be continuously called. But if we just use LCL Idle/Redraw
      behavior (that descends from other widgetsets) then you may find that:
      - during mouse look things "stutter" --- no Idle, not even Redraw,
        happens regularly.
      - during mouse drag Redraw may be regular, but still Idle are not called
        (so e.g. animations do not move, instead they suddenly jump a couple
        of seconds
        forward when you stop dragging after a couple of seconds).

      Note that TCastleWindow (with backends other than LCL) do not have this
      problem. Maybe we process events faster, so that we don't get clogged
      during MouseLook?

      We can't fix it by hacking Application methods,
      especially as LCL Application.ProcessMessage may handle a "batch"
      of events (for example, may be ~ 100 GTK messages, see
      TGtkWidgetSet.AppProcessMessages in lazarus/trunk/lcl/interfaces/gtk/gtkwidgetset.inc).
      So instead we hack it from the inside: from time to time
      (more precisely, LimitFPS times per second),
      when receving an often occuring event (right now: just MouseMove),
      we'll call the DoUpdate, and (if pending Invalidate call) Paint methods.

      In theory, we could call this on every event (key down, mouse down etc.).
      But in practice:
      - Doing this from KeyDown would make redraw when moving by only holding
        down some keys stutter a little (screen seems like not refreshed fast
        enough). Reason for this stutter is not known,
        it also stutters in case of mouse move, but we have no choice in this case:
        either update with stuttering, or not update (continuously) at all.
        TCastleWindow doesn't have this problem, mouse look is smooth there.
      - It's also not needed from events other than mouse move.

      In theory, for LimitFPS = 0, we should just do this every time.
      But this would overload the system
      (you would see smooth animation and rendering, but there will be latency
      with respect to handling input, e.g. mouse move will be processed with
      a small delay). So we use MaxDesiredFPS to cap it. }

    { Event called when the OpenGL context is created.

      You can initialize things that require OpenGL context now.
      Often you do not need to use this callback (engine components will
      automatically create/release OpenGL resource when necessary).
      You usually will also want to implement OnClose callback that
      should release stuff you create here.

      Often, instead of using this callback, it's cleaner to derive new classes
      from TCastleUserInterface class or it's descendants,
      and override their GLContextOpen / GLContextClose methods to react to
      context being open/closed. Using such TCastleUserInterface classes
      is usually easier, as you add/remove them from controls whenever
      you want (e.g. you add them in ApplicationInitialize),
      and underneath they create/release/create again the OpenGL resources
      when necessary.

      Note that we automatically initialize necessary Castle Game Engine resources
      when context is created (@link(GLVersion), @link(GLFeatures) and more).

      @deprecated Instead of this, use TCastleUserInterface and TCastleView virtual

      These two events, OnBeforeRender and OnRender,
      will be always called sequentially as a pair.

      The only difference between these two events is that
      time spent in OnBeforeRender
      is NOT counted as "frame time"
      by Fps.OnlyRenderFps. This is useful when you have something that needs
      to be done from time to time right before OnRender and that is very
      time-consuming. It such cases it is not desirable to put such time-consuming
      task inside OnRender because this would cause a sudden big change in
      Fps.OnlyRenderFps value. So you can avoid this by putting
      this in OnBeforeRender.

      @deprecated Instead of this, use TCastleUserInterface and TCastleView virtual

    { Render window contents here.

      Called when window contents must be redrawn,
      e.g. after creating a window, after resizing a window, after uncovering
      the window etc. You can also request yourself a redraw of the window
      by the Invalidate method, which will cause this event to be called
      at nearest good time.

      Note that calling Invalidate while in EventRender (OnRender) is not ignored.
      It instructs to call EventRender (OnRender) again, as soon as possible.

      When you have some controls on the @link(Controls) list,
      the OnRender event is done @bold(last).
      So here you can draw on top of the existing UI controls.

      It's called right after @code(Pressed[Key]) changed from true to false.

      The TInputPressRelease structure, passed as a parameter to this event,
      contains the exact information what was released.

      Note that reporting characters for "key release" messages is not
      perfect, as various key combinations (sometimes more than one?) may lead
      to generating given character. We have some intelligent algorithm
      for this, used to make Characters table and to detect
      this C for OnRelease callback. The idea is that a character is released
      when the key that initially caused the press of this character is
      also released.

      This solves in a determined way problems like
      "what happens if I press Shift, then X,
      then release Shift, then release X". (will "X" be correctly
      released as pressed and then released? yes.
      will small "x" be reported as released at the end? no, as it was never
      pressed.)

    is done within Create/DestroyHandle.

  { Update event also requires that proper OpenGL context is current.

    This matters because OpenGL resources may be used durign update,
    e.g. TCastleScene.Update will update auto-generated textures,
    doing e.g. TGLGeneratedCubeMapTextureNode.Update.
    This should run in proper OpenGL context.
    Esp. as not all resources must be shared between contexts:
    FBO are not shared in new OpenGL versions, see
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4385655/is-it-possible-to-share-an-opengl-framebuffer-object-between-contexts-threads

    Testcase: open examples/mobile/simple_3d_demo/ in editor,
    open main design,
    click on previews with GeneratedCubeMap like castle_with_lights_and_camera.wrl .
    Without this fix, we'll have an OpenGL error.
