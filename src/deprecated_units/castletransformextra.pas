  { Transformation moving and potentially pushing other objects.
    Good for elevators, doors and such.

    Other objects may be pushed, if @link(Pushes).
    There are two methods of pushing available, see @link(PushesEverythingInside).
    Only the objects with @link(TCastleTransform.CollidesWithMoving) are ever pushed by
    this object (the rest of the world is treated as static, does not interact with
    elevators / doors or such).

    You can also stop/reverse the move to prevent some collisions
    from occuring at all. This way you can e.g. prevent the door
    from automatically closing, if someone/something blocks the way.
    You do this by overriding BeforeTimeIncrease.
    See TDoomLevelDoor.BeforeTimeIncrease in "The Castle" for example how to
    do this. }

      (the rest of 3D world is treated as static, does not interact with

    property Pushes: boolean read FPushes write FPushes default true;

    { If @link(Pushes) is @true, this determines how pushing actually works.
      There two methods:

      @orderedList(
        @item(PushesEverythingInside = @true: We move every
          3D object that is inside our bounding box and has CollidesWithMoving=@true.
          This is sensible if we can reasonably assume that things
          inside our box are standing. For example if this is
          a (vertical or horizontal) elevator, then creatures/items
          are usually standing/lying inside, and naturally move with
          the same speed (and direction) as the elevator.)

        @item(When PushesEverythingInside = @false: We check precise
          collision between 3D objects with CollidesWithMoving=@true
          and our triangle mesh.
          We use TCastleTransform.BoxCollision / TCastleTransform.SphereCollsion
          that can check collisions with TCastleScene precisely.)
      )

      Neither method is really perfect.

      PushesEverythingInside = @false seems like a more precise check,
      as it actually compares the triangle mesh, taking into account
      the interior of (this) moving 3D object. PushesEverythingInside = @true
      just approximates the moving 3D object by it's bounding box.

      On the other hand, PushesEverythingInside = @true makes the elevator
      more "sticky". With PushesEverythingInside = @false,
      when player hits the floor, it takes them some time to raise up.
      This creates a "bouncing camera" effect when the elevator goes up
      quickly: player constantly falls to the ground, tries to get up,
      but elevator moves up and player falls to it's ground again.
      When the elevator goes down, the player/creature constantly falls
      down on it because of gravity, which again causes artifacts
      as gravity may work significantly slower/faster than elavator moving speed.
      When the elevator is a horizontal moving platform, it will "slip"
      from under the player/creature, leaving the poor fella suddenly hanging
      in the air, and falling down because of gravity in the next second.

      In practice: PushesEverythingInside should be @true for small
      containers, when you can reasonably assume that things (creatures,
      player, items) stand inside, and when you intend to use it for transport
      of 3D stuff. For very large moving stuff, that possibly
      interacts with flying players/creatures in some creative way,
      PushesEverythingInside may be @false. }
