  { Basic abstract resource used by all creatures.
    Basic creature can walk or fly, has life and can be hurt,
    can fall down because of gravity and such.

    A "resource" is an information shared by all creatures of given type,
    for example you can have two instances of TCreatureResource: Werewolf
    and Knight. Actually, they would have to be instances of one of
    the TCreatureResource descendants, like TWalkAttackCreatureResource,
    as TCreatureResource is abstract. Using them you can create and place
    on your your level milions of actual werewolves and knights
    (for example instances of TWalkAttackCreature).
    Every werewolf on the level will have potentially different life and
    state (attacking, walking), but all werewolves will share the same
    resource, so e.g. all werewolves will use the same dying animation
    (TWalkAttackCreatureResource.DieAnimation) and dying sound
    (TCreatureResource.SoundDie).

    Note that some of the information stored in resource
    is only used to initialize new creatures and can be changed later
    during creature life, for example TCreatureResource.DefaultMaxLife
    and TCreatureResource.Flying. }

      If it's not defined (or zero) in resource.xml file,

      This radius is used only for alive creatures, because:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(It would cause incorrect results on many dead creatures.
          Dead creatures usually have very different boxes than alive
          (tall alive humanoid creature probably has a small flat bounding
          box when it's lying dead on the ground). So the same radius would not work
          nicely.)

          The main advantage of sphere bounding volumes (over box bounding volumes)
          is for moving (alive) creatures:
          sphere better avoids getting stuck into obstacles (because an animation

      make sure radius is < than PreferredHeight of the creature,
      see TCastleTransform.PreferredHeight, otherwise creature may get stuck into ground.
      In short, if you use the default implementations,
      PreferredHeight is by default @italic(MiddleHeight (default 0.5) *

      I used to have here property like AttacksWhenWalking for the creature,

      "csIdle -> csAttack -> csIdle". But this wasn't good.
      Intelligent creature sometimes attacks when walking (e.g. if it just
      made the distance to the enemy closer) or when standing
      (when the distance was already close enough). And after performing
      the attack, the creature doesn't need to go back to the original state
      before the attack. }

      much anything you want, and this way treat this as an "alternate attack",

      It's not really required to actually fire a missile --- it's only what

    2. It also conflicts with current hack with "MaximumFallingDistance -= 0.01"

    Also growing up doesn't make any sense for missile that explodes on contact
    with ground. So Fall should be overriden to make HitCore,
    and GrowSpeed should be disabled below to be 0. (This is obviously doable.)

    We also want to turn off Gravity to use Gravity=false case when using
    MiddleHeight, so MiddleHeight is always between bounding box bottom and top

      This is crucial for TWalkAttackCreature.Update logic
      that could otherwise sometimes get stuck and continuously switching
      between walk/idle states, because in idle state Middle indicates
      that we should walk (e.g. distance or angle to enemy is not good enough),
      but right after switching to walk the LocalBoundingBox changes
      (because 1st walk animation frame is suddenly different)
      and the distance/angle seems Ok and we switch back to idle and so on,
      in a loop. Once this unfortunate situation is reached, the creature
      is stuck, blinking between two animation frames and two states,
      and never moving (until something else, like enemy (player)
      position changes).

      Safeguards:

      - Don't set to "forced" when it's already forced, as then it could
        cause InternalMiddleForceBoxValue change after each SetState to the box
        from previous state, and we'll be in a similar trouble
        (but with box values always from previous state).
        Trouble (without this safeguard) is reproducible on fps_game
        with knight flying.

      - Don't set to "forced" when switching between other states than idle/walk,
        as the other states logic doesn't allow for such switching
        (states like attack, fireMissile, hurt, die generally continue until
        their time finished; there are no decisions).
        (I didn't actually observed a need for this safeguard so far,
        but it seems reasonable to limit this hack only to idle/walk situation.)

      It must be large enough to compensate even large Resource.AttackMaxDistance,

      our attacks just by standing very close to the creature.
