    (*Level logic class. This is indicated by the "type" attribute in level.xml
      file. By default level logic uses a base TLevelLogic class,
      which corresponds to using @code(type="Level") in level.xml file.

      Changing this allows to use a different ObjectPascal class to implement
      the level behavior.
      You can create your own TLevelLogic descendants and register them
      like

@longCode(#
type
  TMyLevelLogic = class(TLevelLogic)
    { ... override whatever you want ... }
  end;

...
LevelLogicClasses['MyLevel'] := TMyLevelLogic;
#)

      And then you can use @code(type="MyLevel") inside level.xml
      to use your class.
      Many advanced tricks are possible by implementing your own TLevelLogic
      descendant. See Castle1 GameLevelSpecific.pas unit for some examples.

      The core engine (like this CastleLevels unit) doesn't use this title
      much, it's only for progress bars and log messages.

      It is up to the final game code to use this title in more interesting
      ways. For example to show a choice of starting level to the user.
      The core engine doesn't make such "New Game" menus automatically
      (because various games may have widly different ideas how to make it
      and how to show it). But we give the developer tools to make such
      menus easily, for example you can use TCastleOnScreenMenu for this. }

      For example level number may be used to order levels in the menu.

      as levels do not have to be played in a linear order. }

    property Demo: boolean read FDemo write FDemo default false;

    { Was the level played.

      This is automatically managed. Basically, we set it to @true
      when the level is played, and we save it to user preferences.

      Details:
      @unorderedList(
        @item(It is set to @true when loading level.)

        @item(It is saved to disk (user preferences file) when game exits,
          and loaded when game starts. As long as you call @code(Config.Load),
          @code(Config.Save) from CastleConfig unit. To load, you must
          also call explicitly @link(TLevelInfoList.LoadFromConfig Levels.LoadFromConfig) now.)

        @item(The default value comes from DefaultPlayed property,
          which in turn is loaded from level.xml file, and by default is @false.
          To allows you to artificially mark some levels as "Played" on
          the first game run, which may be helpful if you use this property
          e.g. to filter the levels in "New Game" menu.)
      )

      The engine doesn't look at this property for anything,
      whether the level is played or not has no influence over how we work.
      It is just available for your game, for example to use in your
      "New Game" (or similar screen) implementation
      (see @link(Title) for more comments about this). }
    property Played: boolean read FPlayed write FPlayed;

    { Should the level be initially considered "played".
      This determines the initial value of @link(Played) property
      (if nothing was stored in user preferences about this level,
      see TLevelInfoList.LoadFromConfig; or if TLevelInfoList.LoadFromConfig
      is not called by the game).

      How is this information useful, depends on a particular game.
      For example, some games may decide to show in the "New Game"
      menu levels only with Played=true. Some games may simply ignore it. }
    property DefaultPlayed: boolean read FDefaultPlayed write FDefaultPlayed;

      in level.xml. }
    property LoadingImage: TRGBImage read FLoadingImage write FLoadingImage;

    { Vertical position of progress bar when loading the level.
      Between 0 and 1, default value 0.5 means "middle of the screen".
      Should be synchronized with how LoadingImage looks (if you set it),
      to make the progress when loading level look nice.

      Technically, this is used for TProgressUserInterface.BarYPosition. }
    property LoadingBarYPosition: Single

    { Placeholder detection method. See TPlaceholderName, and see
      TGameSceneManager.LoadLevel for a description when we use placeholders.
      Default value is @code(PlaceholderNames['x3dshape']). }
    property PlaceholderName: TPlaceholderName
      read FPlaceholderName write FPlaceholderName;

    { How to interpret the placeholders direction (like the initial
      creature direction on the level).
      Some placeholders (currently, only creatures) may be used to determine
      initial direction of the resource. For example, the direction
      the creature is initially facing.
      This direction is calculated as the transformation
      of given placeholder applied to this 3D vector.

      The correct value may depend on the exporter you used to create 3D models,
      and on the exporter settings (how and if it rotates the model when exporting,
      and is this rotation recorded in placeholder transformation
      or applied directly to mesh coordinates). It may also depend on personal
      preference, as it determines how you set resources in your 3D modelling tool
      (like Blender).

      Fortunately, the default value (+X vector) is suitable for at least
      2 common situations:

      @orderedList(
        @item(If your exporter rotates the world to turn +Z up into +Y up.
          (This is the case of default Blender X3D exporter with default settings.))

        @item(If your exporter doesn't rotate the world.
          (You can configure Blender exporter to behave like this.
          You may also then configure engine to use +Z as up vector for everything,
          see "Which way is up?" on [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/tutorial_up.php].))
      )

      In Blender it's useful to enable the "Display -> Wire" option for placeholder
      objects, then Blender will show arrows inside the placeholder.
      +X of the arrow determines the default direction understood by our engine. }
    property PlaceholderReferenceDirection: TVector3Single
      read FPlaceholderReferenceDirection write FPlaceholderReferenceDirection;

    { Music played when entering the level. }
    property MusicSound: TSoundType read FMusicSound write FMusicSound

      For the specification of level.xml format see
      [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/creating_data_levels.php] .

      This should be called after resources (creatures and items) are known,
      as they may be referenced by level.xml files.
      So call @link(T3DResourceList.LoadFromFiles Resources.LoadFromFiles)
      @italic(before) calling this (if you
      want to use any creatures / items at all, of course).

      All TLevelInfo.Played values are initially set to @false.
      You must call LoadFromConfig @italic(after) calling this
      to read TLevelInfo.Played values from user preferences file.

      Note that on Android, searching the Android asset filesystem
      recursively is not possible (this is a fault of Android NDK API...).
      So instead of this method, you should use AddFromFile repeatedly
      to explicitly list all level.xml locations.

    procedure LoadFromFiles;

      TLevelInfo.Played for any purpose (for example,
      to decide which levels are displayed in the menu). By default,
      our engine doesn't look at TLevelInfo.Played for anything. }

      @unorderedList(
        @item(@bold(Set scene manager 3D items):

          Clear all 3D items from @link(TCastleSceneManager.Items)
          list (except @link(TCastleSceneManager.Player)), clear
          @link(TCastleAbstractViewport.Camera Camera)
          and @link(TCastleSceneManager.MainScene) as well.
          Then load a new main scene and camera, adding to
          @link(TCastleSceneManager.Items) all 3D resources (creatures and items)
          defined by placeholders named CasRes* in the main level 3D file.)

        @item(@bold(Make sure 3D resources are ready:)

          Resources are T3DResource instances on @link(Resources) list.
          They are heavy (in terms of memory use and preparation time),
          so you don't want to just load everything for every level.
          This method makes sure that all resources required by this level
          are prepared. All resources requested in level.xml file
          (in <resources> element in level.xml),
          as well as resources requested in player.xml file,
          as well as resources with AlwaysPrepared (usually: all possible items
          that can be dropped from player inventory on any level)
          will be prepared.)

        @item(@bold(Initialize move limits and water volume from placeholders).
          Special object names CasMoveLimit and CasWater (in the future:
          CasWater* with any suffix) in the main scene 3D model
          determine the places where player can go and where water is.

          When CasMoveLimit object is missing,
          we calculate it to include the level bounding box, with some
          additional space above (to allow flying).)

        @item(@bold(Initialize sectors and waypoints from placeholders).
          Special shape names CasSector* and CasWaypoint* can be used
          in level 3D model to help creature AI.
          You can add and name such shapes in 3D modeler, like Blender,
          and they will be automatically understood by the engine when loading level.

          Objects named CasSector<index>[_<ignored>] define sectors.
          The geometry of a sector with given <index> is set to be the sum
          of all CasSector<index>* boxes.
          Sectors are numbered from 0.

          Objects named CasWaypoint[<ignored>] define waypoints.
          Each waypoint is stored as a 3D point, this point is the middle of the
          bounding box of the object named CasWaypoint[<ignored>].

          After extracting from level 3D model,
          sectors and waypoints are then connected together by
          TSectorList.LinkToWaypoints. The idea is that you can go from
          one sector to the other through the waypoint that is placed on
          the border of both of them.)

        @item(@bold(Prepare everything possible for rendering and collision
          detection) to avoid later preparing things on-demand (which would cause
          unpleasant delay during gameplay).
          E.g. prepares octree and OpenGL resources.)
      )

      The overloaded version with a LevelName string searches the @link(Levels)
      list for a level with given name (and raises exception if it cannot
      be found). It makes sense if you filled the @link(Levels) list before,
      usually by @link(TLevelInfoList.LoadFromFiles Levels.LoadFromFiles)
      call. So you can easily define a level in your data with @code(name="xxx")
      in the @code(level.xml) file, and then you can load it
      by @code(LoadLevel('xxx')) call.

      It's important to note that @bold(you do not have to use
      this method to make a 3D game). You may as well just load the 3D scene
      yourself, and add things to TCastleSceneManager.Items and
      TCastleSceneManager.MainScene directly.
      This method is just a very comfortable way to set your 3D world in one call
      --- but it's not the only way.

      You do not have to call this in normal circumstances,
      as each LoadLevel automatically clears previous 3D world. If fact,
      you should not call this in normal circumstances:
      calling this prevents the next LoadLevel to reuse resources
      that were needed by both old and new level.
