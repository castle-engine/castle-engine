  { Basic resource of an item that can be picked up, used and such.

    A "resource" is an information shared by all items of given type,
    for example you can have two instances of class TItemResource:
    Sword and LifePotion. (Actually, TItemWeaponResource, which is a descendant
    of TItemResource, sounds like a better candidate for the Sword.)
    Using them, you can create milions of actual swords and life potions,
    and place them of your level (as well as in inventories of creatures
    able to carry items). Every life potion (TInventoryItem instance)
    may keep some individual information (for example, how much of the potion
    is already used/drunk), but all life potions will share the same
    TItemResource instance, so e.g. they all will be displayed using the same model
    on 3D level (TItemResource.BaseAnimation) and the same image in 2D inventory
    (TItemResource.Image). }

      The core engine itself doesn't use it, and doesn't force anything
      about such image (whether it should have some specific size,
      whether it should have alpha channel and such).
      It is up to the final game to make use of these images.

      If you're wondering how to generate such image:
      one option is to open the item 3D model in
      [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/view3dscene.php]
      and use "Display -> Screenshot ..." menu option (maybe the one
      that makes transparent background).
      It is usually a good idea to also remember the camera used for such
      screenshot with "Console -> Print Current Camera (Viewpoint)..."
      menu option. }

    { The largest possible bounding box of the 3D item,
      taking into account that actual item 3D model will be rotated when
      placed on world. You usually want to add current item position to this. }
    property BoundingBoxRotated: TBox3D read FBoundingBoxRotated;

    { Create item. This is how you should create new TInventoryItem instances.
      It is analogous to TCreatureResource.CreateCreature, but now for items.

      Note that the item itself doesn't exist on a 3D world --- you have to
      put it there if you want by TInventoryItem.PutOnWorld. That is because items
      can also exist only in player's backpack and such, and then they
      are independent from 3D world.

      @bold(Examples:)

      You usually define your own item resources by adding a subdirectory with
      resource.xml file to your game data. See
      [http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/creating_data_resources.php]
      and engine tutorial for examples how to do this. Then you load the item
      resources with

@longCode(#
var
  Sword: TItemResource;
...
  Resources.LoadFromFiles;
  Sword := Resources.FindName('Sword') as TItemResource;
#)

      where 'Sword' is just our example item resource, assuming that one of your
      resource.xml files has resource with name="Sword".

      Now if you want to add the sword to your 3D world by code:

      Because TInventoryItem instance is automatically
      owned (freed) by the 3D world or inventory that contains it, a simplest
      example how to add an item to your 3D world is this:

@longCode(#
  Sword.CreateItem(1).PutOnWorld(SceneManager.World, Vector3Single(2, 3, 4));
#)

      This adds 1 item of the MyItemResource to the 3D world,
      on position (2, 3, 4). In simple cases you can get SceneManager
      instance from TCastleWindow.SceneManager or TCastleControl.SceneManager.

      If you want to instead add sword to the inventory of Player,
      you can call

@longCode(#
  SceneManager.Player.PickItem(Sword.CreateItem(1));
#)

      This assumes that you use SceneManager.Player property. It's not really
      obligatory, but it's the simplest way to have player with an inventory.
      See engine tutorial for examples how to create player.
      Anyway, if you have any TInventory instance, you can use
      TInventory.Pick to add TInventoryItem this way. }

  { An item that can be used, kept in the inventory, or (using PutOnWorld
    that wraps it in TItemOnWorld) dropped on 3D world.

    many "stacked" items, all having the same properties. }

    { Try to sum (stack) the given Item with current TInventoryItem.
      The idea is that if player has 5 arrows, and picks an item representing
      another 5 arrows, then we sum then into one TInventoryItem instance
      representing 10 arrows.

      Various games, and various items,
      may require various approaches: for example, maybe you don't want
      some items to stack at all (e.g. you want to only allow stacking
      for items naturally appearing in vast quantities, like arrows and bolts
      and bullets (if you represent them as TInventoryItem at all)).
      Maybe you want to allow stacking only to centain number, e.g. arrows
      are summed into groups of maximum 20 items, anything above creates new stack?
      Overriding this procedure allows you to do all this.

      You can here increase the Quantity of current item,
      decrease the Quantity of parameter Item. In case the parameter Item
      no longer exists (it's Quantity reaches 0) you have to free it
      and set to @nil the Item parameter, in practice you usually want
      to call then @code(FreeAndNil(Item)).

      The default implementation of this in TInventoryItem class
      allows stacking always, as long as the Resource matches.
      This means that, by default, every TItemResource is existing at most once
      in T3DAliveWithInventory.Inventory. }
    procedure Stack(var Item: TInventoryItem); virtual;

    { Item is picked by an alive player/creature.
      The default implementation in this class adds the item to the Inventory
      by calling T3DAliveWithInventory.PickItem.

      You can override this to cause different behavior (for example,
      to consume some items right at pickup).
      Remember that this method must take care of memory management
      of this item. }

      player's owned Items. Implementation of this method can change
      our properties, including Quantity.
      As a very special exception, implementation of this method
      is allowed to set Quantity of Item to 0.

      Never call this method when Player.Dead. Implementation of this
      method may assume that Player is not Dead.

      Caller of this method should always be prepared to immediately
      handle the "Quantity = 0" situation by freeing given item,
      removing it from any list etc. }
