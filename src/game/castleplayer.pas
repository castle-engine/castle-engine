  TPlayerSwimming = (psNo,
    { Player is floating on the water.
      Not falling down, but also not drowning.
      This means that player head is above the water surface
      but his feet are in the water. In some sense he/she is swimming,
      in some not. }
    psAboveWater,
    psUnderWater);

  { Player, 3D object controlling the camera, main enemy of hostile creatures,
    carries a backpack, may cause fadeout effects on screen and such.

    Note that you can operate on player even before level is loaded,
    before TCastleSceneManager and such are initialized.
    This allows to create player before level is started
    (create it from scratch, or by loading from save game),
    and "carry" the same player instance across various loaded levels.

    @link(Dead) or @link(Blocked) player behaves much like alive and normal player.
    For example, it still has an associated Camera that can animate by code
    (e.g. to apply physics to the dead player body,
    because player was killed when he was flying, or it's
    corpse lays on some moving object of the level --- like elevator).
    However, Camera input shortcuts will be cleared, to prevent user from
    directly moving the camera and player.

    Do not do some stuff when player is dead:
    @unorderedList(
      @item No calling PickItem, DropItem, UseItem.
      @item(No increasing Life (further decreasing Life is OK).
        This implies that once Player is Dead, (s)he cannot be alive again.)
      @item No changing EquippedWeapon, no calling Attack.
    )

    Note that every player, just like every T3DOrient actually,
    has an associated and magically synchronized T3DOrient.Camera instance.
    Ancestor T3DOrient only takes care about synchronizing the view vectors
    (position, direciton, up) and doesn't care about camera otherwise.
    We synchronize more in TPlayer class:

    @unorderedList(
      @item(@link(Flying) is synchronized with TWalkCamera.Gravity.)
      @item(Various camera inputs are automatically adjusted based on current
        player state (@link(Dead), @link(Blocked)) and global PlayerInput_Xxx
        values, like PlayerInput_Forward.)
    )

    The outside code may still directly access and change many camera
    properties. Camera view vectors (position, direciton, up),
    TWalkCamera.PreferredHeight,
    TWalkCamera.RotationHorizontalSpeed
    TWalkCamera.RotationVerticalSpeed. In fact, it's Ok to call
    TWalkCamera.Init, and it's Ok to assign this Camera to TCastleSceneManager.Camera,
    and TGameSceneManager.LoadLevel does this automatically.
    So scene manager will update Camera.ProjectionMatrix,
    call camera events like TCamera.Press, TCamera.Update and such.)

      How it interacts with FlyingTimeout: Setting this property
      to any value removes any timeout set by FlyingTimeout.

      Set this only with value > 0.

      Camera.IsWalkingOnTheGround can change quite rapidly

      on un-flat terrain --- then Camera.IsWalkingOnTheGround
      switches between @true and @false quite often).
      But it is undesirable to change FootstepsSoundPlaying
      so often, as this causes footsteps to suddenly stop, then play,
      then stop again etc. --- this doesn't sound good.

      So I use ReallyWalkingOnTheGroundTime to mark myself
      the time when Camera.IsWalkingOnTheGround was true.
      In normal situation I would set NewFootstepsSoundPlaying to stNone
      when Camera.IsWalkingOnTheGround = @false.
      But now I set NewFootstepsSoundPlaying to stNone only if
      Camera.IsWalkingOnTheGround = @false

      stop this sound whenever player stops walking. This is not so easy.
      This occurs when FootstepsSoundPlaying changes from non-stNone to stNone,
      but this occurs also when CastlePlay starts loading new level, enters
      game menu etc. --- in all these cases player footsteps must stop.
      So it's better (simpler) to simply use non-looping sound for footsteps.

    - The first frame with TPlayer could be incorrect, as 3D objects drawn before
      will have 0..1 DepthRange that may overlap with our weapon.
      It works now only because default player positions are when
      the weapon doesn't overlap with level in 3D.
    - We never fix the DepthRange back to 0..1.

    The idea of using DepthRange for layers seems quite good, it's
    quite a nice solution,
    - you don't have to split rendering layers in passes, you can render
      all objects in one pass, just switching DepthRange as necessary.
    - you can set DepthRange for 3D objects inside T3DList,
      like here TPlayer will just affect every child underneath.

    But it has to be implemented in more extensible manner in the future.
    It should also enable X3D layers. }

  { For player, our Position is already the suitable "eye position"
    above the ground.

    Note that Player.Gravity remains false for now (only Player.Camera.Gravity
    is true), so the player is not affected by simple gravity implemented in
    Castle3D unit, so there's no point in overriding methods like PreferredHeight.
    TWalkCamera.Gravity does all the work now. }
