  { Basic abstract resource used by all creatures.
    Basic creature can walk or fly, has life and can be hurt,
    can fall down because of gravity and such.

    A "resource" is an information shared by all creatures of given type,
    for example you can have two instances of TCreatureResource: Werewolf
    and Knight. Actually, they would have to be instances of one of
    the TCreatureResource descendants, like TWalkAttackCreatureResource,
    as TCreatureResource is abstract. Using them you can create and place
    on your your level milions of actual werewolves and knights
    (for example instances of TWalkAttackCreature).
    Every werewolf on the level will have potentially different life and
    state (attacking, walking), but all werewolves will share the same
    resource, so e.g. all werewolves will use the same dying animation
    (TWalkAttackCreatureResource.DieAnimation) and dying sound
    (TCreatureResource.SoundDie).

    Note that some of the information stored in resource
    is only used to initialize new creatures and can be changed later
    during creature life, for example TCreatureResource.DefaultMaxLife
    and TCreatureResource.Flying. }

      (in case of TWalkAttackCreatureResource) their move direction is free.

      For all creatures, TCreature.Gravity (inherited from T3D.Gravity)
      is set to @code("not Flying") at creation. (Except TMissileCreatureResource,
      that has special approach to gravity,
      see TMissileCreatureResource.DirectionFallSpeed.)

      For TWalkAttackCreatureResource, additionally Flying allows to move
      freely, while non-flying creatures are constrained to move
      (and think about moving) only horizontally.

      You can always change the Gravity property of a particular creature
      during it's lifetime, so a creature may start/stop flying during game.
      For example, this is how you can let your creatures to use jetpack and such.
      Be careful about creature @link(Radius) and @link(MiddleHeight) properties
      in this case, make sure that the values (explicitly set or automatically
      calculated) are suitable for both flying and non-flying states. }

    { Sphere radius for collision detection for alive creatures.
      Must be something <> 0 for collision detection.

      You can define it in the creature resource.xml file,
      by setting radius="xxx" attribute on the root <resource> element.

      If it's not defined (or zero) in resource.xml file,
      then we use automatically calculated radius using RadiusCalculate,
      that is adjusted to the bounding box of the animation.

      Note that this radius is not used at all when creature is dead,
      as dead creatures usually have wildly
      different boxes (tall humanoid creature probably has a flat bounding
      box when it's dead lying on the ground), so trying to use (the same)
      radius would only cause problems.
      Using sphere collision is also not necessary for dead creatures.
      See T3D.Sphere for more discussion about when the sphere is a useful
      bounding volume.

      The sphere center is the Middle point ("eye position") of the given creature.
      If the creature may be affected by gravity then
      make sure radius is < than PreferredHeight of the creature,
      see T3D.PreferredHeight, otherwise creature may get stuck into ground.
      In short, if you use the default implementations,
      PreferredHeight is by default @italic(MiddleHeight (default 0.5) *
      bounding box height). Your radius must be smaller
      for all possible bounding box heights when the creature is not dead. }

      (see TGameSceneManager.LoadLevel for placeholders docs,
      and see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/castle-development.php

      @italic(Design notes:)
      I used to have here property like AttacksWhenWalking for the creature,
      to indicate whether creature changes state like
      "csWalk -> csAttack -> csWalk" or
      "csIdle -> csAttack -> csIdle". But this wasn't good.
      Intelligent creature sometimes attacks when walking (e.g. if it just
      made the distance to the enemy closer) or when standing
      (when the distance was already close enough). And after performing
      the attack, the creature doesn't need to go back to the original state
      before the attack. }
    property AttackAnimation: T3DResourceAnimation read FAttackAnimation;

    { Firing missile animation. Optional. Similar rules like AttackAnimation,
      but here the "highlight" is not directly hurting enemy,
      but firing a new creature (missile).

      You can always override TWalkAttackCreature.FireMissile to do pretty
      much anything you want, and this way treat this as an "alternate attack",
      not necessarily firing a missile.
      It's not really required to actually fire a missile --- it's only what
      happens at the default TWalkAttackCreature.FireMissile implementation,
      and it happens only if FireMissileName is not empty. }
    property FireMissileAnimation: T3DResourceAnimation read FFireMissileAnimation;

      Dying animation is not displayed in a loop, after it runs
      it's duration we constantly show the final frame,
      at the TCreature instance will keep existing on the level.
      Unless you set RemoveDead to @true, then the dead creature
      will be completely removed from the level.

      For best look: Beginning should roughly glue with any point of
      the idle/attack/walk animations. }

      is only used when creature is killed by hitting it from the front.

      This should be <= AttackMaxDistance or FireMissileMaxDistance,

    We tried to enable it once, but:
    1. Normal gravity doesn't change the direction, so arrows fall down
       but they keep pointing upwards. This is noticeable to the player
       that looks at the arrow.
    2. It also conflicts with current hack with "MaximumFallingDistance -= 0.01"
       inside Castle3D gravity. It could probably be fixed better,
       but since the 1st problem would remain anyway...
    Also growing up doesn't make any sense for missile that explodes on contact
    with ground. So Fall should be overriden to make HitCore,
    and GrowSpeed should be disabled below to be 0. (This is obviously doable.)

    We also want to turn off Gravity to use Gravity=false case when using
    MiddleHeight, so MiddleHeight is always between bounding box bottom and top
    for missiles. See T3DCustomTransform.MiddleHeight. }

      This is crucial for TWalkAttackCreature.Update logic
      that could otherwise sometimes get stuck and continously switching
      between walk/idle states, because in idle state Middle indicates
      that we should walk (e.g. distance or angle to enemy is not good enough),
      but right after switching to walk the LocalBoundingBox changes
      (because 1st walk animation frame is suddenly different)
      and the distance/angle seems Ok and we switch back to idle and so on,
      in a loop. Once this unfortunate situation is reached, the creature
      is stuck, blinking between two animation frames and two states,
      and never moving (until something else, like enemy (player)
      position changes).

      Safeguards:

      - Don't set to "forced" when it's already forced, as then it could
        cause MiddleForceBoxValue change after each SetState to the box
        from previous state, and we'll be in a similar trouble
        (but with box values always from previous state).
        Trouble (without this safeguard) is reproducible on fps_game
        with knight flying.

      - Don't set to "forced" when switching between other states than idle/walk,
        as the other states logic doesn't allow for such switching
        (states like attack, fireMissile, hurt, die generally continue until
        their time finished; there are no decisions).
        (I didn't actually observed a need for this safeguard so far,
        but it seems reasonable to limit this hack only to idle/walk situation.)
