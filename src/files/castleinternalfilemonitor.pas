  { Monitor when files change on disk,
    to enable auto-reloading them.
    Use only through singleton @link(FileMonitor).

    To make the file monitor actually do something, you have to set both
    PossiblyEnabled and Enabled to @true.

    - Before first URL calls Watch, call FileMonitor.MakePossiblyEnabled.

      Right now this is automatically done when DEBUG is defined when
      compiling CGE. Also CGE editor does it.

      This allows to completely avoid any overhead of FileMonitor in release
      version, for users, when data is never observed, because it is not supposed
      to change.

    - Set Enabled to @true anytime you want.
      It can be toggled between @false and @true freely.

      Only when both PossiblyEnabled and Enabled are @true,
      the monitor actually does its work fully.

      When PossiblyEnabled = @true but Enabled = @false,
      the monitor does minimal work (collecting the files to watch)
      to allow to later resume in case you toggle Enabled to @true.
      But otherwise monitor doesn't check file times,
      doesn't generate OnChanged events. }

        { URL of the watched file.
          Always an absolute URL.
          For now only file:// URLs are supported.
          The purpose of this is to watch files on regular filesystem,
          files in castle-data:// can be resolved to regular files too on desktop.
          We use URLs (not filenames) just in case in the future more options
          will be possible (e.g. in case CGE editor will run on web some day).}
        Url: String;

        { Last seen modified time of the file.
          0 if cannot be obtained. }
        LastModified: TDateTime;

        { Always non-nil, non-empty instance
          of TSimpleNotifyEventList with non-nil and valid callbacks to call. }
        OnChanged: TSimpleNotifyEventList;

        { When this is > 0, we are in the middle of iteration over
          OnChanged callbacks. In this case outside code should not modify
          OnChanged count (it can only set some items to @nil)
          or free this instance.

          This prevents undefined behavior in case some OnChanged
          callback unwatches the URL, changing the OnChanged order
          or even freeing TFileInfo class while we're in the middle of iteration
          over OnChanged.

          Testcase: just change image used by TCastleImageControl, once.
          It will then exactly do this: TCastleImagePersistent.ReloadUrl
          temporatily unwatches the URL, freeing TFileInfo, only to watch it again.
          The incorrect log
            Notified about change of URL "" because last modification time...
          with empty URL (which shall not be possible, TFileInfo never has URL='')
          appears, without the protection given by this field.

      on singleton @link(FileMonitor) in this unit.

      but it is safer: This way external code is secured in case
      it will call "unwatch" after finalization of this unit is done,
      at which point the @link(FileMonitor) has been freed and shall not be
      recreated.

  if InsideExecuteAll = 0 then
    OnChanged.Pack;

  { If OnChanged.Count = 0 we could actually destroy ourselves,
    doing Self.Destroy. That's what happens if someone unwatches the file
    for the last time when InsideExecuteAll = 0.

    But doing so would cause more trouble than benefits:

    - All code calling ExecuteAllChanged would have to be prepared that
      TFileInfo later possibly doesn't exist. E.g. our own UpdateLastModified
      would have to exit after ExecuteAllChanged, not do anything more.

    - And actually, leaving TFileInfo with empty OnChanged means less work.
      Because almost always, when someone unwatches URL during
      OnChanged.ExecuteAll, it means the URL was unwatched only temporarily
      by ReloadUrl.
      It is watched immediately right after.
      So destroying TFileInfo instance only to recreate it later is pointless
      work.

    - And it is harmless. TFileInfo with empty OnChanged works OK.
