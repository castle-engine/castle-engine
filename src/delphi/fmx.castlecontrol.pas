{ How to implement calling Update continuously?
  Similar choice as castlewindow_form.inc discusses.

  - USE_TIMER is preferred.
    It "just works" from user point of view.
    We use this on all platforms (Windows)...

  - ...except Linux, when with FMXLinux we failed to make it work.
    It means user code must execute loop in a special way.
    In the main program code, instead of

      Application.Run;

    do

      TCastleControl.ApplicationRun;

    And if anywhere you do

      Application.ProcessMessages;

    enhance it with

      Application.ProcessMessages;
      TCastleControl.ProcessTasks; // additional CGE processing
}

    before we actually create window by setting ControlType. }
  TabStop := true;

  CanFocus := True;

  { Makes the Presentation be TWinNativeGLControl, which has HWND.
    Do this after FContainer is initialized, as it may call CreateHandle,
    which in turn requires FContainer to be created.

    Note that we cannnot do this at design-time (in Delphi IDE):

    - Switching to TControlType.Platform at design-time
      creates additional weird (visible in task bar, detached from form designer)
      window on Windows, alongside main Delphi IDE window.

      User can even close this window, causing crashes
      (later when closing the FMX form, there will be exception,
      because the Windows handle went away and FMX is not prepared for it).

    - We *can* create OpenGL context in this weird window, and render there...
      But all my experiments to attach it to form designer in Delphi IDE failed.
      Overriding TWinNativeGLControl.CreateParams to

      1. Params.Style := Params.Style or WS_CHILD
      2. Params.WndParent := ContainerHandle;
      3. CreateSubClass(Params, 'CastleControl');

      .. yield nothing.

      1 and 2 should indeed not be necessary, this is done by default by FMX,
      we have WS_CHILD by default.

      None of the above cause our rendering to be attached to Delphi IDE
      as you would expect.

    - FMX controls cannot render in native style at design-time it seems.

      That is also the case for TMemo or TEdit,
      their rendering can be native only at runtime (if you set their ControlType
      to platform), at design-time they just display the "styled" (non-native)
      along with an icon informing they will be native at runtime.

  { On Linux, it's especially important to check Terminating (not just Terminated)
    below.

    That's because FMXLinux seems to rely on GTK mechanism to exit
    main loop when user calls Application.Terminate, which means it assumes
    that you have executed Application.Run. (But we cannot use Application.Run
    because timer is unreliable on FMXLinux and would sometimes hang application
    rendering, see USE_TIMER comments.) Calling "Application.Run" sets
    only Terminating:=true and makes GTK error:

       gtk_main_quit: assertion 'main_loops != NULL' failed

    We can't really prevent GTK error,

  { TODO (but it seems FMXLinux issue -- we should report):
    On FMXLinux, not using "Application.Run"
    means that FMXLinux never frees the Application singleton.

    Consequently, things owned by Application are never freed,
    TForm.OnDestroy callbacks are not run,
    and component destructors like TCastleControl.Destroy are not run.
    Things just leak at program exit.

    It seems FMXLinux "TPlatformLinux.Destroy"
    should just call "FreeAndNil(Application)". This is what Delphi built-in
    "TPlatformWin.Destroy" and "TPlatformCocoa.Destroy" are doing.
    It also makes sense since "TPlatformLinux.Create" creates the Application
    singleton.

    In fact, I haven't found *how is Application freed when
    we call Application.Run*. FMXLinux never seems to free Application.
    Unlike Windows and macOS FMX platforms.
    But logging shows that forms *are* freed at application exit
    if we run Application.Run, but not otherwise.

    This is reproducible in FMX almost-blank application, without any CGE,
    just remove Application.Run but call Application.RealCreateForms .
    You will notice that form OnCreate callback executes,
    but form OnDestroy callback never happens. }
