    It's used by @link(TShapeShadowVolumes.ManifoldEdges),

  TManifoldEdge = record
    { Index to get vertexes of this edge.

      During rendering, the edge is defined by these two vertexes:
      - Triangles[0][VertexIndex]
      - Triangles[0][(VertexIndex + 1) mod 3]

      These are indexes to @link(TShapeShadowVolumes.TrianglesListShadowCasters)
      in turn. This way if a shape changes during animation,
      we need to recalculate @link(TShapeShadowVolumes.TrianglesListShadowCasters),
      but the @link(TShapeShadowVolumes.ManifoldEdges) and
      @link(TShapeShadowVolumes.BorderEdges) may stay unchanged. }
    VertexIndex: Cardinal;

    { Indexes to @link(TShapeShadowVolumes.TrianglesListShadowCasters) array }
    Triangles: array [0..1] of Cardinal;

    { These are vertex values at VertexIndex and (VertexIndex+1)mod 3 positions,
      but @italic(only at generation of manifold edges time).
      Updating this data later would be costly.
      However, using these when generating
      makes a great speed-up when generating manifold edges.

      Memory cost is acceptable: assume we have model with 10 000 faces,
      so 15 000 edges (assuming it's correctly closed manifold), so we waste
      15 000 * 2 * SizeOf(TVector3) = 360 000 bytes... that's really nothing
      to worry (we waste much more on other things).

      Checked with "The Castle": indeed, this costs about 1 MB memory
      (out of 218 MB...), with really lot of creatures... On the other hand,
      this causes small speed-up when loading: loading creatures is about
      5 seconds faster (18 with, 23 without this).

      So memory loss is small, speed gain is noticeable (but still small),
      implementation code is a little simplified, so we're keeping this for now. }

    { ManifoldEdges is a list of edges that have exactly @bold(two) neighbor
      triangles, and BorderEdges is a list of edges that have exactly @bold(one)
      neighbor triangle. These are crucial for rendering shadows using shadow
      volumes.

      Edges with more than two neighbors are allowed. If an edge has an odd
      number of neighbors, it will be placed in BorderEdges. Every other pair
      of neighbors will be "paired" and placed as one manifold edge inside
      ManifoldEdges. So actually edge with exactly 1 neighbor (odd number,
      so makes one BorderEdges item) and edge with exactly 2 neighbors
      (even number, one pair of triangles, makes one item in ManifoldEdges)
      --- they are just a special case of a general rule, that allows any
      neighbors number.

      Note that vertexes must be consistently ordered in triangles.
      For two neighboring triangles, if one triangle's edge has
      order V0, V1, then on the neighbor triangle the order must be reversed
      (V1, V0). This is true in almost all situations, for example
      if you have a closed solid object and all outside faces are ordered
      consistently (all CCW or all CW).
      Failure to order consistently will result in edges not being "paired",
      i.e. we will not recognize that some 2 edges are in fact one edge between
      two neighboring triangles --- and this will result in more edges in
      BorderEdges.

      Both of these lists are calculated at once, i.e. when you call ManifoldEdges
      or BorderEdges for the 1st time, actually both ManifoldEdges and
      BorderEdges are calculated at once. If all edges are in ManifoldEdges,
      then the scene is a correct closed manifold, or rather it's composed
      from any number of closed manifolds.

      Results of these functions are cached, and are also owned by this object.
