{ @abstract(TGLWindow is a window with associated OpenGL context.)

  @link(Application) object (instance of class @link(TGLApplication))
  is a central manager of all active (that is, visible) @link(TGLWindow)
  windows.

  Using this unit:

  @orderedList(
    @item(Declare and create @link(TGLWindow) instance. (Or a descendant
      like @link(TGLUIWindow) or @link(TGLWindowDemo)).
      By convention, I name it @code(Glw) in my programs.)

    @item(Assign Glw properties and callbacks like
      @link(TGLWindow.OnDraw OnDraw),
      @link(TGLWindow.OnResize OnResize),
      @link(TGLWindow.Width Width),
      @link(TGLWindow.Height Height),
      @link(TGLWindow.Caption Caption).)

    @item(Call @link(TGLWindow.Init Glw.Init),
      this will actually show the window and it's
      associated OpenGL context. It also calls
      @link(TGLWindow.EventInit EventInit)
      (@link(TGLWindow.OnInit OnInit) callback)
      and @link(TGLWindow.EventResize EventResize)
      (@link(TGLWindow.OnResize OnResize) callback).)

    @item(Call @link(TGLApplication.Run Application.Run).
      This will enter message loop that will call
      appropriate windows' callbacks at appropriate times
      (OnDraw, OnKeyDown, OnResize, OnIdle and many more).
      There are also some Application callbacks, like
      @link(TGLApplication.OnIdle Application.OnIdle).

      For more advanced needs you can use something like
        @longCode(#  while Application.ProcessMessage do <something>;#)
      instead of Application.Run.

      You can also call @link(TGLWindow.InitAndRun Glw.InitAndRun),
      this is just a shortcut for Glw.Init + Application.Run.)

    @item(Application.Run ends when you call @link(TGLApplication.Quit Application.Quit)
      or when you close last visible window using @link(TGLWindow.Close Close(true)).

      User is also allowed to close a window using WindowManager facilities
      (clicking on "X" button in the frame corner, pressing Alt+F4 or something
      like that). By default, such user action will make window close
      (but you can freely customize what your program does when user
      tries to close the window using callback
      @link(TGLWindow.OnCloseQuery OnCloseQuery)).)
  )

  So the simplest example of using this unit can look like this:

@longcode(#
  uses GLWindow;

  var
    Glw: TGLWindowDemo;

  procedure Draw(Glwin: TGLWindow);
  begin  ...  end;

  procedure Resize(Glwin: TGLWindow);
  begin  ...  end;

  begin
   Glw := TGLWindowDemo.Create(Application);
   Glw.OnResize := @Resize;
   Glw.InitAndRun('Simplest GLWindow example', @Draw);
  end.
#)

  @italic(More object-oriented approach):
  Instead of assigning callbacks (OnDraw, OnResize etc.) you can
  also derive a new class from TGLWindow and override some of virtual
  methods, like EventDraw, EventResize etc. Every callback OnXxx
  has a corresponding EventXxx method. In TGLWindow class,
  all EventXxx methods simply call appropriate OnXxx callbacks
  (this way you can use whatever approach you like -- OOP or not-OOP).

  This is a second version of the "simplest example" program above,
  this time using OOP approach:

@longcode(#
  uses GLWindow;

  type
    TMyWindow = class(TGLWindow)
      procedure EventDraw; override;
      procedure EventResize; override;
    end;

  procedure TMyWindow.EventDraw;
  begin  ...  end;

  procedure TMyWindow.EventResize;
  begin  ...  end;

  var
    Glw: TMyWindow;
  begin
    Glw := TMyWindow.Create;
    try
      Glw.Caption := 'Simplest GLWindow example using more OOP';
      Glw.InitAndRun;
    finally Glw.Free end;
  end.
#)

  The non-OOP approach has one advantage: you can easily switch all callbacks
  to some other set of callbacks using TGLWindowCallbacks,
  TGLWindow.GetCallbacksState, TGLWindow.SetCallbacksState.
  Using these functions I implemented unit
  @link(GLWinModes) and then, on top of this, I implemented some very
  handy things like modal message boxes (unit @link(GLWinMessages))
  and progress bar (unit @link(ProgressGL)). These units give you some typical
  GUI capabilities, and they are in pure OpenGL.

  Using OOP approach (overriding EventXxx methods instead of registering OnXxx
  callbacks) you can not do such things so easily -- in general, you have
  to define something to turn off special EventXxx functionality
  (like SetDemoOptions in TGLWindowDemo and UseControls in TGLUIWindow)
  and you have to turn them off/on when using GLWinModes
  (mentioned TGLWindowDemo and TGLUIWindow are already handled in
  GLWinModes). TODO: I shall do some virtual methods in TGLWindow
  to make this easy.

  Random features list:

  @unorderedList(

    @item(TGLApplication.ProcessMessage method.
      This allows you to reimplement
      event loop handling, which is crucial for implementing things
      like @link(MessageInputQuery) function that does modal GUI dialog box.)

    @item(TGLWindow.Pressed to easily and reliably check which keys
      are pressed.)

    @item(Frames per second measuring, see @link(TGLWindow.Fps),)

    @item(A menu bar under WinAPI and GTK backends.

      You can attach a menu to a window. Menu structure is constructed using
      various descendants of TMenuEntry class.
      Then you have to assign such menu structure
      to TGLWindow.MainMenu property. When GLWindow is implemented on top
      of GTK_1 or GTK_2 or WINAPI or GLUT we will show this menu and call
      TGLWindow.EventMenuCommand (TGLWindow.OnMenuCommand) when user clicks some menu item.
      Other implementations (XLIB for now) ignore MainMenu.

      See @code(kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/glwindow/menu_test.pasprogram)
      for an example how to use the menu.)

    @item(Changing screen resolution and bit depth,
      see TGLApplication.VideoChange.

      Also you can request various OpenGL buffers: color buffer with alpha
      channel (@link(TGLWindow.AlphaBits AlphaBits)),
      stencil buffer (@link(TGLWindow.StencilBufferBits StencilBufferBits)),
      double buffer (@link(TGLWindow.DoubleBuffer DoubleBuffer)), accumulation buffer
      (@link(TGLWindow.AccumBufferBits AccumBufferBits)),
      multisampling (full-screen antialiasing) buffers (@link(TGLWindow.MultiSampling MultiSampling))?
      )

    @item(You can use native modal dialogs for things such as file selection.
      GTK implementation will use GTK dialogs, WinAPI implementation
      will use Windows dialog boxes, XLib implementation will fall back
      on GLWinMessages text input.

      See TGLWindow.FileDialog (for opening and saving files) and
      TGLWindow.ColorDialog (for choosing RGB colors).)

    @item(TGLWindow.ParseParameters method allows you to easily initialize TGLWindow
      properties like initial size and position using command-line
      parameters like @code(@--geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT), @code(@--display) etc.)
  )

{ Choose GLWindow implementation ------------------------------------------ }

{ You must define one of the symbols GLWINDOW_GTK_1, GLWINDOW_GTK_2,
  GLWINDOW_WINAPI (only under Windows),  GLWINDOW_XLIB (only where X11
  and Xlib are available, which usually means "only under UNIX"),
  GLWINDOW_GLUT.

  Of course the list of available implementations may be extended
  with time (although I do not plan it for now, since I'm happy with
  available implementations).

  Here are short descriptions for each implementation:

  GLWINDOW_GTK_1 and GLWINDOW_GTK_2
    GLWINDOW_GTK_1 is based on GTK 1.x (>= 1.2) using GtkGLArea widget.
    Made around beginning of march 2004. Historically the first,
    it is now by all means superseded by GTK 2 version.
    Saying it clearly: @bold(do not use GTK_1, use GTK_2 instead).

    GLWINDOW_GTK_2 is based on GTK 2.x, using GtkGLExt extension.
    Made 2005-02.

    MainMenu is implemented as a nice-looking GTK menu bar.
    Dialog windows implemented using GTK dialog windows.
    Generally, has a nice native look of GTK application.

    Implementations on top of GTK should work under any OS where GTK works.
    Currently both GTK_1 and GTK_2 are tested under Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.
    GTK_2 is also tested on Mac OS X.

    GLWINDOW_GTK_1:
    Known problems of only GLWINDOW_GTK_1 (fixed in GTK_2):
    - Some key shortcuts for menu items will not work,
      so don't use them. It seems that this is an issue with GTK 1,
      that simply can't be fixed in GLWindow.
      These keys are: Delete, BackSpace, '?' key, Tab.
      All of them work in GLWINDOW_GTK_2 version, with the exception
      of Tab key.
    - When FullScreen = true and MainMenu <> nil, result is not perfect
      because things like gnome-panel may cover your fullscreen window.
      Solved in GLWINDOW_GTK_2, can't be cleanly solved with GTK_1.
    - Under Windows be warned that GTK 1.3 has somewhat buggy
      key events handling - sometimes I don't get keyup events for
      appropriate keys, sometimes keydown events for some keys
      are temporarily blocked. A little code in glwindow_gtk.inc
      was added to workaround some problems, but definitely
      this still does not work as smoothly as it should.
    - Menu mnemonics are not implemented (I don't know how to *easily*
      do them in GTK_1, and I don't really care since GTK_2 version
      is completely stable now). They are simply removed when Caption
      is displayed.
    - File filters are not implemented. This is fixed in GTK_2 by
      using newer GtkFileChooser.
    - TGLWindow.Message*, TGLWindow.SetMousePosition are not implemented
      with GTK 1 backend (raise "not implemented" exceptions).
      They probably could be implemented, but (since GTK 1 is obsolete now)
      I didn't feel the need.

    GLWINDOW_GTK_2:
    This is now stable and tested and is much better than GTK_1.
    At some point, this may be renamed to simply GLWINDOW_GTK
    and compatilibity with GTK 1.x may be dropped.

    Also FullScreen is cleanly implemented in GTK_2,
    never using override_redirect,
    so Alt+Tab always works (even when your window is fullscreen),
    and things like gnome-panel will never cover your fullscreen window.

    Known problems:
    - TryVideoChange is not implemented, i.e. always returns false.
      I don't know how to cleanly implement it using GTK.
    - Under Windows, window will be always resizeable by user, even if
      you set ResizeAllowed <> raAllowed.
      This is masked in our unit (so your OnResize callback will not get
      to know such thing), so it's harmless for correctness of your programs,
      but, anyway, user can do it.

  GLWINDOW_WINAPI
    Based on Windows API.

    MainMenu is implemented as WinAPI menu bar. So it looks nice.
    Dialog windows are implemented as common Windows dialog boxes.
    Has a nice native look on Windows.

  GLWINDOW_XLIB
    Based on XLib units. No X toolkit is used.

    MainMenu is not implemented (it's ignored).
    That's not easy to implement when you don't want to use any X toolkit.
    And it's not a good idea to implement it yourself (without any standard
    GUI toolkit) --- this makes many Xlib programs ugly, because every single one
    uses his own GUI. In other words:
    if you want to have MainMenu then just use GLWINDOW_GTK_1/2.

    Dialog boxes are implemented using GLWinMessages.MessageXxx.
    So they are not very comfortable to user, but they work.

    On Unix platforms, whether you should use GLWINDOW_GTK_2 or
    this GLWINDOW_XLIB depends on your program.

    - For utility programs, usually GLWINDOW_GTK_2.
      You want the menu bar and native (GTK-themed) look of dialog boxes.

    - For fullscreen games, usually GLWINDOW_XLIB.
      You usually do not use the menu bar in fullscreen games,
      and do not want popup dialog boxes. Instead you draw everything
      inside your OpenGL context, which makes your game look the same
      regardless of the platform and GUI can be styled to your game theme.
      For example, menu may be done by TGLMenu, and dialog boxes
      by GLWinMessages.

      As a bonus, XLIB allows you to change screen resolution when
      starting the game, which may be useful. And has one dependency less
      (GTK is commonly installed, but gtkglext is not, and GLWINDOW_GTK_2
      requires gtkglext).

  GLWINDOW_GLUT
    Based on glut library. There's little use of implementing
    GLWindow on top of glut library since the initial idea of GLWindow
    was to overcome many glut shortcomings. The only advantage of this is that
    such implementation of GLWindow may be used for various testing purposes.

    MainMenu is implemented as glut pop-up menu. Activated by right mouse button.
    Looks ugly and has a lot of usability problems, but works.

    TryVideoChange is simply not implemented, always returns false.

    Known problems:
    (they are specific to GLWINDOW_GLUT and will not be fixed.
    Just use other GLWINDOW_xxx backend if you don't want these problems):
    - Lack of Application.ProcessMesssages (although freeglut allows me to fix it,
      maybe I'll do it someday)
    - Application.Run does never return (because it must be implemented as a
      single call to glutMainLoop)
    - Key up / down (with K_xxx constants) are rather poorly simulated.
    - FlushRedisplay always redraws the window
      (it can't know whether window really needs redraw or not,
      so it redraws it always).
    - Even when ResizeAllowed <> raNotAllowed user will be able
      to change size of our window (using window manager-specific
      things, like dragging our window's border)
      but we will simply "pretend" that nothing happened
      (TGLWindow instance will not change it's Width/Height,
      will not do OnResize event etc.).
      Similar with (Min|Max)(Width|Height) constraints:
      they can't be forced using glut, we will simply ignore
      the fact if they will be broken by user.
    - I can't pass to glut value of StencilBufferBits so
      I'm simply saying to glut that I want stencil buffer
      when StencilBufferBits > 0, and then I'm checking
      using glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_STENCIL_SIZE) how many stencil bits I have.
      Analogous for DepthBufferBits, AlphaBits, AccumBufferBits.
    - Menu mnemonics are not implemented.
      They are simply removed when Caption is displayed.
    - CustomCursor is not implemented. Cursor = gcCursor is treated like mcDefault.

  GLWINDOW_TEMPLATE
    This is a special dummy implementation, useful only as an example for programmers
    that want to implement another GLWindow backend (e.g. based on Mac OS X Carbon).
    It compiles, but actually nothing works --- file glwindow_implementation_template.inc
    is just a dummy implementation with TO-DO marks that you should fill.
}

{ If GLWindow implementation is not choosen at this point, choose
  default (best, most functional and stable) implementation
  for a given OS.

  This way you can override configuration below by compiling GLWindow
  with some GLWINDOW_xxx symbol already defined. }

{ To make new GL Window implementation -------------------------------------

  - Define a symbol like GLWINDOW_FOO for a new implementation,
    document it in the "available implementations list" above.
  - Create a file glwindow_foo.inc with contents from
    glwindow_implementation_template.inc
    and conditionally include it from glwindow_implementation_specific.inc.
  - Adjust defining GLWINDOW_HAS_PROCESS_MESSAGE,
    GLWINDOW_HAS_VIDEO_CHANGE and GLWINDOW_USE_PRIVATE_MODIFIERS_DOWN
    for your implementation.
  - Implement all methods in glwindow_foo.inc. You wil find the specification
    what each method should do in the specification of the interface of this
    module.
  - Call all TGLWindow.DoXxx functions at appropriate places from your
    implementation.
    You can call all DoIdle and DoTimer for all Application.Active[] windows
    using Application.DoActiveWindowsIdle/Timer (this will give usually inefficient
    but working implementation)
  - Call TGLApplication.DoSelfIdle and DoSelfTimer when appropriate.
    Remember that you can always assume that the ONLY existing instance of
    TGLApplication is Application.
  Some important things that can be easily forgotten:
  - Remember that probably you will have to call ReleaseAllKeysAndMouse
    when user switches to another window or activates MainMenu.

{ Configure some debugging options of GLWindow ---------------------------- }

{ When GLWINDOW_LOG_EVENTS is defined, TGLWindow events will be logged.
  This means logging (using KambiLog) at begin, end, and at exception exit
  inside all TGLWindow events (EventXxx methods).
  Very useful, although floods your log with incredible amount of messages
  very quickly.

  Actually, GLWINDOW_LOG_EVENTS by itself turns logging for @italic(almost)
  all events. For the really really often events (draw, idle, timer,
  mouse move for now), you'll need to define also GLWINDOW_LOG_EVENTS_ALL
  (relevant only if GLWINDOW_EVENTS_LOG).

{ Two reasons why sometimes GTK backend call some X-specific things:

  1. Grrrr. Implementing TGLWindow.SetMousePosition is a real hack for GTK.

     First of all, there is no GDK or GTK function for this.
     (confirmed by google, e.g. see here
     [http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2001-January/msg00035.html]).
     You have to bypass GTK and use things like Xlib's XWarpPointer or
     Windows' SetCursorPos. So this is getting very dirty already ---
     suddenly GLWindow's GTK backend stops to be portable.

     Moreover, to use XWarpPointer, you have to get Xlib parameters
     (X window id and display pointer) from GTK window. And here comes
     another surprise, this time caused by FPC bindings: GTK 1 bindings
     don't include macro GDK_WINDOW_XID. They include macro
     GDK_WINDOW_XDISPLAY but it seems incorrectly defined
     (should take GdkWindow not PGdkWindowPrivate ?).
     GTK 2 bindings don't include these macros too, but GTK 2 library contains
     functions gdk_x11_drawable_get_xid/xdisplay and I can get to them.

     All in all, right now I implemented TGLWindow.SetMousePosition
     only for GTK 2 under Unix. It's possible to do this for GTK 1 under Unix,
     but more hacking is needed (hint: fix GTK 1 bindings in this regard).
     It's possible to do this for Windows, you have to use SetCursorPos
     (see the real Windows backend TGLWindow.SetMousePosition implementation).

  2. Screen resizing.

     I have to use there XF86VidMode extension, just like for GLWINDOW_XLIB
     backend. And, just like for TGLWindow.SetMousePosition, I'll need
     for this some functions available only in GTK 2 library that
     "uncover" X11 internals related to GTK for me. }

{ An important property of a GLWindow implementation is whether such
  implementation can provide TGLWindowManager.ProcessMessage method.
  E.g. glut implementation cannot provide this. Xlib and WinAPI can.
  We're defining symbol GLWINDOW_HAS_PROCESS_MESSAGE for such implementations.
  A special include file GLWindow_has_process_message.inc is provided
  to help such implementations.
  Implementations without TGLWindowManager.ProcessMessage usually use some
  higher-level interface. They are slightly easier to implement, but they
  lack functionality -- I need TGLWindowManager.ProcessMessage to do such
  things as GLWinMessages. }

{ TODO list ------------------------------------------------------------------

  (? means "I'm not sure whether to implement it")

  only winapi :
  - windowActive / appActive - byc moze zrobic nieco inaczej i wszedzie ?
    czy decyzja w ProcessMessage o znaczeniu window/appActive jest dobra ?
    byc moze przeniesc z private do public na odczyt ?
  - k_alt zrobic - trzeba przechwytywac sys_keydown ale wtedy
    albo przechwytujemy wszystkie (w rezultacie
    blokujac standardowe klawisze Alt+F4 lub Alt+spacja Windowsowi)
    albo mamy problem gdy user wejdzie w system menu : wtedy dostaniemy
    zdarzenie alt+down ale nikt nie raczy nam przeslac alt+up.
    !@#& Windows. W glutcie po prostu przechwytuja zawsze, blokujac
    Alt+F4 i Alt+spacja. Czy to w ogole mozna zrobic lepiej ?

  only glut :
  - zrobic przechwytywanie klikania na przyciki "Zamknij" pod glutem
    (glut wysyla wtedy PostQuitMessage i konczy program ! nie chce tego !)
  - ReleaseAllKeysAndMouse - call this when user switches to another window
    or activates a menu

  only GLWINDOW_GTK_1/2:
  - in InitImplDepend implement
    MaxWidth/Height (Maybe these properties should be removed ?
      They are made for symmetry with MinWidth/Height. Are they really useful ?)
  - with GTK 2:
    - Implement better fullscreen toggle now (that doesn't need
      recreating window).
      Update docs about capabilities of GTK_2 implementation.
    - Value of propery FullScreen should change at runtime,
      and parts of things that I'm doing now in InitImplDepend
      should be done on such changes.
      This way I should be able to react to fullscreen changes
      forced by user (using window manager, not F11) really cleanly.

  general:
  - napisac jakies programy ktore sprawdzilyby ze
    DepthBufferBits, AlphaBits
    dzialaja, i sprawdzic je pod wszystkimi implementacjami
  - Width, Height, Left, Top zaimplementowac tak zeby przeniesc je
    do sekcji "mozesz nimi pozniej manipulowac" ?
  - zrobic implementacje przez SDL ?
  - use EnumDisplaySettings instead of such variables as
    VideoColorBits / VideoScreenWidth / VideoFrequency,
    do some proc DisplayExists and EnumDisplays
  - do parametru --fullscreen-custom dodac mozliwosc podania
    VideoColorBits, VideoFrequency
  - zrobic zdarzenia mousewheel
  - dodac mozliwosc zrobienia FullScreen w stylu SDLa : program moze zmienic

  - OnTimer interface sucks -- it doesn't allow you to register many timeout
    functions for different timeouts.
  - add to multi_glwindow testing call to FileDialog and ColorDialog
    to test

  menu things:
  - The method of updating menu (always rebuild menu in MainMenuChanged)
    is awfully simple. Well, it works prefectly, because menus are small
    and it's not a problem to update them whole. But it should be improved.
    Probably the only visible problem is that if you use "tearoffs" with
    GTK menu, they disappear on menu change.

  I'm aliasing here TKey type and key constants from Keys unit,
  this way code that uses GLWindow unit has automcatically
  available TKey type and key constants (because a lot of code
  using GLWindow unit uses also these type/constant, so I want
  to avoid adding "Keys" unit to uses clauses).

  Once the "reuse" keyword will be implemented in FPC,
  this can be done using something like "reuse Keys".

      TGLWindow.

      should be reflected in user interface. It's called only when
      MainMenu <> nil.
      Note: state of MainMenu <> nil must not change, i.e. you can't use this
      to remove or add main menu to window. You can call this method
      only if MainMenu <> nil when you did Init on this object and
      then you changed something in MainMenu.Items.

      Useful when user somehow switches to another window / control
      (e.g. when he opens our MainMenu), such that we are then unable to catch
      following KeyUps and MouseUps. So user simply STOPS controlling outr

      all keys and mouse buttons.

      This should be implemened as "Result := true" if we have to process
      keypresses in GLWindow to pass them as menu commands, e.g. when GLWindow
      works on top of glut or Xlib.
      When GLWindow works on top of GTK or WinAPI that allow us to do a "real"
      menu, this should be implemented as "Result := false". }
    function RedirectKeyDownToMenuCommand: boolean;

    { DoXxx methods ------------------------------------------------------------

      The general idea of DoXxx methods: "Call me on Xxx event.
      I'll do everything that needs to be done and that is not specific to
      GLWindow-implementation.".
      GLWindow-implementation specific methods should not ever call EventXxx
      directly (and nothing should ever call OnXxx directly besides EventXxx),
      they should use DoXxx methods.

      Remember that no DoXxx may be called from CloseImplDepend.

      Below is the detailed specification, but summing some things up
      you don't have to worry about these things when you use DoXxx methods
      (these things are fully handled by DoXxx methods):
      - updating state of MousePressed
      - updating state of Pressed (Pressed.Keys, Pressed.Characters etc.)
      - updating state of MouseX, MouseY
      - calling MakeCurrent before every EventXxx
      - flushing gl commands (and swapping gl buffers when DoubleBuffer'ing)
      - taking care of AutoRedisplay
      - updating Width, Height (and updating it with accordance to
        Min/MaxWidth/Height and ResizeAllowed)
      - checking MainMenu.Enabled
    }

    { DoResize with FromIndependentInit = true is called only once
      (and exactly once) from TGLWindow.Init implementation.
      So all GLWindow-implementation code should always
      pass FromIndependentInit = false (EVEN if it may be called from
      InitImplDepend (that is called before DoResize in Init) !).

      Some more notes about calling DoResize from InitImplDepend:
      in this case DoResize will NOT call EventResize (since the first callback
      that should be called for a window is EventInit). We will always after
      EventInit call DoResize(..., true), so this should not be a problem
      anywhere. You can simply call DoResize from InitImplDepend to tell us what
      real Width/Height we have, and the real EventResize will be called
      just at a later time.

      You can pass here ANY AWidth, AHeight. It will be automatically clipped
      here to fit in Min/MaxWidth/Height and to satisfy ResizeAllowed.

      Also MakeCurrent + EventResize will be called (probably; sometimes
      DoResize may decide to not call EventResize - e.g. when ResizeAllowed
      =raNotAllowed and FirstTime = false then it's useless to call here
      EventResize).

      Remember : this function does not automatically call PostRedisplay.
      You must make sure that soon after changing size of the window
      you will call DoDraw (e.g. you can call PostRedisplay after
      calling DoResize; but usually (under WinAPI, Xlib, glut, gtk)
      it's not needed, i.e. WinAPI, Xlib, glut and gtk all take care of this
      automatically). }
    procedure DoResize(AWidth, AHeight: integer; FromIndependentInit: boolean);
    { Wywoluj kiedy user kliknie na przycisku "Zamknij" itp.
      Wywola EventCloseQuery i ew. Close (and Close will execute EventClose,
      CloseImplDepend etc.). Note that there is no DoClose method and there
      should not be such method : always use DoCloseQuery. }
    procedure DoCloseQuery;

    { Do MakeCurrent,
         EventBeforeDraw,
         EventDraw (inside Fps._RenderBegin/End)
         flush gl command pipeline (and swap gl buffers if DoubleBuffer)

      - Take care of AutoRedisplay, like

          @code(if AutoRedisplay then PostRedisplay;)

        So specific GLWindow implementations need not to worry about
        AutoRedisplay. They only have to implement PostRedisplay. }

    { DoKeyDown/Up: pass here key that is pressed down or released up.

      Only DoKeyDown: pass also CharKey. Pass Key = K_None if this is not

      as char. But never pass both Key = K_None and CharKey =#0

      EventXxx ? Mianowicie, procedury EventXxx sa wirtualne. W zwiazku z tym
      pozwalaja one na konstruowanie uzytecznych podklas klasy TGLWindow.

      Przy okazji procedury te sa nie w protected ale w public aby umozliwic
      wygodne wywolywanie ich spoza klasy TGLWindow, np. gdy chcesz recznie

      albo nawet
        if Assigned(glwin.OnResize) then
         try glwin.OnResize(glwin) except on BreakGLWinevent do ; end

      Allowing this is a good thing, as it means our process doesn't eat

      On the other hand, you cannot allow this if you want to do some

        jest zupelnie zbedne w pozostalych przypadkach, gdy ResizeAllowed<>

      is always the first executed callback and EventClose (OnClose)
      is always last. Some examples (like gl_win_events.pasprogram)
      confirm that this is really useful.

      One more thing: in EventInit (OnInit) you already have valid
      Width/Height values, i.e. those values were already adjusted

    { Required depth buffer precision. Zero means that we don't need
      depth buffer at all. We may get depth buffer with more precision
      than requested (we may even get depth buffer when we set
      DepthBufferBits = 0), this all depends on graphic card.

      Default value is 16 (DefaultDepthBufferBits),
      which is a reasonable default for 3D programs
      that want to work with depth test enabled.

      @italic(Design notes:) One may ask why default value is not 0 ?

      @orderedList(
        @item(
          Most programs using OpenGL use depth testing, so many programs
          would have to call something like @code(Glw.DepthBufferBits := 16).)

          Often graphic cards / window systems / OSes give you an OpenGL
          context with depth buffer @italic(even if you don't need depth buffer).
          I don't say that it's bad. But it makes very easy to forget about
          doing @code(DepthBufferBits := something-non-zero;).
          If you're writing 3d program and sitting on some
          system that always gives you depth buffer (even if DepthBufferBits = 0)
          then it may happen that you forget to write in your program
          @longCode(#  glw.DepthBufferBits := 16;#)

          And while on your system everything will work, you will
          receive errors on other systems because you forgot to request a
          depth buffer.)
      )

      Of course, if you are writing a program that does not need depth buffer
      you should set glw.DepthBufferBits := 0. The only advantage of having
      default DepthBufferBits = 16 is that if you forget to set
      Glw.DepthBufferBits := 0 your programs will still work (most graphic cards
      will give you some depth buffer anyway).

      multisampling capabilities (GLX_ARB_multisample for glX on Unix
      or WGL_ARB_multisample for wgl on Windows). MultiSampling says how
      many samples per pixel should be done (try typical 2 or 4 values).

      So the only thing remaining for your program to make anti-aliasing
      working is to use core OpenGL extension GL_ARB_multisample:
      [http://opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/multisample.txt].

      As you can guess, in 99% you want to leave this as @true, as the

      on the desktop, right? But in some very special cases you really

      [http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/view3dscene.php#section_screenshot].

      A cleaner way to achieve this would be to actually initialize

      and gives you more possibilities (e.g. window size doesn't limit
      the screenshot size, liki it @italic(can) with current approach).

    { This is probably the most important callback.
      You should redraw your window here.

      It will be called when your window contents must be redrawn,
      e.g. after creating a window, after resizing a window, after uncovering
      the window etc. You can also request that this callback should be
      called in a short time by PostRedisplay.

      Note: calling PostRedisplay while in EventDraw (OnDraw) is NOT ignored.
      It means that in a short time next EventDraw (OnDraw) will be called. }

      (more specifically, EventBeforDraw will be always called right before
      EventDraw). So those two functions, EventBeforeDraw and EventDraw,
      will be always called sequentially as a pair. So what is the use of
      BeforeDraw ?

      Only one thing differs OnDraw and OnBeforeDraw: time spent in OnBeforeDraw
      (more specifically, in EventBeforeDraw) is NOT counted as "frame time"
      by Fps.FrameTime. This is useful when you have something that needs
      to be done from time to time right before OnDraw and that is very
      time-consuming. It such cases it is not desirable to put such time-consuming
      task inside OnDraw because this would cause a sudden big change in
      Fps.FrameTime value (and DrawSpeed). So you can avoid this by putting
      this in OnBeforeDraw. Of course, using OnBeforeDraw also means that the
      program will not always be time-based. By using OnBeforeDraw instead
      of OnDraw you're breaking the rules that are designed to make time-based
      program (a program that adjusts itself to the speed of computer it is on).
      But this is sometimes desirable when you have something that you want
      to do really seldom (e.g. only when user presses some special key)
      (but that is also time-consuming).

      E.g. view3dscene uses Scene.Render. From time to time user presses
      a key like "g" or "m" that force the whole Scene to be regenerated.
      This means that a call to Scene.Render inside OnDraw takes sometimes
      much more time than it usually does. This gives some unpleasant effect
      because when the user views the scene using "Examine" mode
      then after pressing "g" DrawSpeed is (for only one short moment !)
      very big. And this means that after pressing "g" user sees 1. first,
      it takes some time to regenerate the model 2. second, after regenerating
      the model there is a sudden jump in the amount the object is rotated
      (because DrawSpeed is big). And the second thing is bad.
      It can avoided by putting Scene.PrepareRender(true) after OnKeyDown,
      OnMouseDown etc. But the simplest (and more elegant) way
      is to put Scene.PrepareRender(true) only in OnBeforeDraw. }

    { OnKeyDown(Self, Key, c) occurs when user presses some key that
      we can represent as key: TKey and/or c: char.

      Not all keyboard keys can be represented as TKey value. There are
      some keys that generate sensible char values, but still cannot be
      represented as TKey value, e.g. key '/' does not have any K_Xxx
      constant for now but can be expressed as char '/'.
      So you can get Key = K_None is such situations, e.g. OnKeyDown
      will be called like OnKeyDown(Self, K_None, '/').

      Character c is based on pressed key, current Modifiers state,
      state of keys like "Caps-Lock" , maybe some OS configurarion
      (like locale-specific chars, e.g. polish "ogonki"), etc. In general,
      it is operating-system (and window-system, and GLWindow-backend)
      specific. Not all key presses are representable as
      char, so you may get c = #0 in such situations.
      E.g. "up arrow" key does not have a corresponding char code,
      so OnKeyDown may be called like OnKeyDown(Self, K_Up, #0).

      Never will both Key = K_None and c = #0 (this would be rather useless
      event...). (Unless you will explicitely call EventKeyDown(K_None, #0),
      which you should never do.)

      Note: once I had here separate events, OnKeyPress (with only c: char)
      and OnKeyDown (with only Key: TKey). But this was very error-prone:
      for one user key press you could get two events (e.g.
      OnKeyDown(K_C) and then OnKeyPress('c')). Problems with this were easily
      avoidable in small programs (where you can see all your OnKeyDown and
      OnKeyPress handlers in one file), but in large programs they were producing
      very nasty bugs. E.g. imagine that you handle in OnKeyDown key K_Enter
      by doing GLWinMessages.MessageOK. But then each time user presses
      Enter key you
      1. handle it in OnKeyDown calling GLWinMessages.MessageOK
      2. GLWinMessages.MessageOK changes your GLWindow callbacks
         so that OnKeyPress(#13) makes GLWinMessages.MessageOK exit.
      3. but then you're getting OnKeyPress(#13) event (because K_Enter
         is converted to #13 char). So GLWinMessages.MessageOK ends.
      This looked like a bug in GLWinMessages.MessageOK. But actually
      it was a bug in callbacks design: you were getting two callbacks
      (OnKeyDown amd OnKeyPress) for one event (user presses a key).

      KeyDown moze byc pod wplywem key repeata.
      Tzn. ze jesli uzytkownik bedzie trzymal klawisz przycisniety to my
      mozemy dostawac co chwila nowe KeyDown. Pod niektorymi
      systemami moze byc wtedy tak ze przed kazdym KeyDown bedziemy
      dostawali "udawane" KeyUp (udawane, bo user tak naprawde ani na chwile
      nie puscil klawisza) a pod niektorymi nie bedziemy dostawali KeyUp
      (bedziemy po prostu dostawali KeyDown(k) podczas gdy juz wczesniej
      Pressed[k] = true). Piszac program musisz byc gotow na obie mozliwosci.
      Podsumowujac : nie patrz na KeyDown(k) jako na "zdarzenie ktore zachodzi
      gdy Pressed[k] zmienia sie z false na true". To tak nie dziala.
      Patrz raczej na to jako na zdarzenie po ktorym Pressed[k] na pewno
      jest true. }
    property OnKeyDown: TKeyCharFunc read FOnKeyDown write FOnKeyDown;

    { Called when user releases a pressed key. I.e. it's called right after
      Pressed[Key] changed from true to false.

      Key is never K_None.

      C may be #0 is no representable character is released.
      When C is <> #0, we detected that some character is released.
      This is connected with setting Characters[C] from @true to @false.

      Note that reporting characters for "key release" messages is not
      perfect, as various key combinations (sometimes more than one?) may lead
      to generating given character. We have some intelligent algorithm
      for this, used to make Characters table and to detect
      this C for OnKeyUp callback. The idea is that a character is released
      when the key that initially caused the press of this character is
      also released.

      This solves in a determined way problems like
      "what happens if I press Shift, then X,
      then release Shift, then release X". (will "X" be correctly
      released as pressed and then released? yes.
      will small "x" be reported as released at the end? no, as it was never

      When handling this event, you must remember that user
      may try to close our window at any time.
      E.g. if you're implementing here somehing like showing user
      text "You cannot quit now" or asking user "Do you really want to quit"
      remember that while you display such message to user and you're
      processing events (e.g. looking for keypress "Yes" or "No"),
      user may try to close your window again.

      GLWinMessages unit offers some nice routines that you can safely
      use here, e.g. you can use it inside OnCloseQuery like

        if MessageYesNo(glwin, 'Are you sure you want to quit ?') then
         Close;

      Inside MessageYesNo, when we're processing events,
      and waiting for user's answer (yes or no),
      futher OnCloseQuery events will be ignored, so everything will work OK.

      This event is also useful if you want to call Close(false)
      on closing the window (i.e. QuitWhenLastWindowClosed = false).
      By default, if this event is undefined, we call Close(true)
      when user tries to close the window. }

      sa wykorzystywane najczesciej wlasnie aby iterowac po wszystkich /
      niektorych okiekach wsrod Application.Active[] i cos w nich robic,

      You can change this freely while Closed.

      You can change this almost freely while not Closed: you can use
      various properties of TMenuEntry descendants (adding, deleting items
      from TMenu, changing Caption, Key, CharKey, Checked properties --
      anything) and you can change value of MainMenu BUT you must not
      change MainMenu <> nil state when the window is not Closed.
      I.e. if you called Init with MainMenu = nil, then MainMenu must stay
      nil unit Close. If you called Init with MainMenu <> nil, then you
      can assign other MainMenu values while not Closed, but only values
      <>nil. I.e. you can't set MainMenu to nil if you called Init
      with MainMenu <> nil.
      See @code(kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/glwindow/menu_test_alternative.pasprogram)
      for demo of changing value of MainMenu while window is not Closed.

      Note that MainMenu.Enabled is honoured (as well as Enabled
      for all menu items inside, of course).
      You can use this to disallow user from clicking on the whole
      menu. When MainMenu.Enabled = @false then
      no MenuItem.DoCommand, no EventMenuCommand
      will be called when user presses some menu item.
      When user presses some keyboard shortcut for some menu item,
      no MenuItem.DoCommand and no EventMenuCommand will be called,
      but instead normal EventKeyDown (OnKeyDown) will be called.

      When it is useful to set this to false ?
      For example hen using GLWinModes. When you're changing modes (e.g. at the
      beginning of GLWinMessages.MessageOk) you're temporary setting
      OnMenuCommand to nil, but this doesn't block TMenuItem.DoCommand
      functions. The only way to block menu from triggering ANY event is to

      Left-top corner is (0, 0), and right-bottom is (Width - 1, Height - 1).
      This is consistent with most window libraries (GTK, LCL etc.).
      Plese note that Y coordinate is reversed with respect to the typical OpenGL
      Ortho2D projection, if needed you'll have to adjust it (by using
      @code(Height - MouseY)).

      Note that we have mouse capturing (when user presses and holds
      the mouse button, all the following mouse events are reported to this
      window, even when user moves the mouse outside of the window).
      This is typical of all window libraries (GTK, LCL etc.).
      This implicates that mouse positions are sometimes tracked also
      when mouse is outside the window, which means that mouse position
      may be outside the rectangle (0, 0) - (Width - 1, Height - 1),
      so it may even be negative.

      In all situations the MouseX, MouseY is the latest known mouse position.
      The only exception is within EventMouseMove (and so, also in OnMouseMove
      callback): MouseX, MouseY is then the previous known mouse position,

      For example, maybe you set (Depth|Stencil|Accum)BufferBits properties
      to too high values. It's guaranteed that even when EGLContextNotPossible
      was raised, the window remains in correct (Closed) state, so you
      can try to lower some requirements and call init once again.
      For example:

          allowed options are
          --fullscreen (ustawia Fullscreen := true)
          --geometry followed by param WIDTHxHEIGHTsXOFFsYOFF
            gdzie WIDTH, HEIGHT sa liczbami calkowitymi, XOFF, YOFF sa liczbami
            calkowitymi z opcjonalnym znakiem.
            (ustawia Fullscreen := false i Width, Height, Left, Top odpowednio
             - patrz 'man X' po opis co mozna wyrazic parametrem -geometry)

        poScreenGeometry
          --fullscreen-custom WIDTHxHEIGHT (ustawia Fullscreen = true,
             VideoResize := true, VideResizeWidth/Height inicjuje i robi VideoChange)

        poDisplay
          --display (set Application.XDisplayName)

      Multiple options of the same kind are allowed, for example two options
      --fullscreen --geometry 100x100+0+0 are allowed. Each of them will
      have appropriate effect - in the above example, --fullscreen param
      will be useless (it will be "overriden" by --geometry param that
      comes later). This is to allow flexible calling my programs from
      shell scripts etc.

      parametru za --geometry lub brak parametru za --geometry) ->
      -> wyjatek EInvalidParams.

      wiesz ze user podal window size i position i nie powinnismy juz
      sami tego ustawiac. Chociaz zazwyczaj wystarczy po prostu ustawic

      The idea is that if you call @code(ParseParameters(AllowedOptions))
      in your program then you should also show your users somwhere
      (e.g. in response to "--help" option) the list of allowed
      options obtained by @code(ParseParametersHelp(AllowedOptions))
      (i.e. with the same value of AllowedOptions).

      the trailing newline (newline char after the last line).

      base/README.kambi_command_line_params

      If AddHeader then it adds text
        'Window options:' +nl
      at the beginning. This is just a small thing that allows you
      to comfortably use the output of this function as a whole
      paragraph (separated from the rest of your "--help" text
      by e.g. empty lines around). }

    { dialog boxes using GUI ------------------------------------------------ }

    { About all dialogs:
      - Behaviour of callbacks:
        callbacks of Application and callbacks of other TGLWindow MAY be called while
        the dialog is open. Callbacks of THIS object (OnXxx) will not be
        called. You should treat XxxDialog like
          TGLMode.Create(Self, ...)
          TGLWindowState.SetStandardNoCloseState
          ....
          TGLMode.Free
      - How does these dialogs look like ?
        Under GTK and WinAPI implementations we use native dialogs of these.
        Under Xlib implementation we simply fallback on
        GLWinMessages.Message*.
        Under glut this is not implemented.
    }

    { Title is some dialog title.
      FileName specifies default filename (path and/or name, or '' if current dir
      is the default dir and there is no default filename). Note that if you
      have to specify only path in FileName you have to end this paths with
      PathDelim (otherwise '/tmp/blah' would not be clear: whether it's
      filename 'blah' in '/tmp/' dir or whether it's only dir '/tmp/blah/' ?).

      Returns true and sets FileName accordingly if user chooses some filename and
      accepts it. Returns false if user cancels.

      if OpenDialog: may try to force user to only enter existing (and readable)
      FileName. (It may be unable to force this from user, or it may fail,
      so you should watch for some exceptions when opening a file
      (as it always the case with opening files, anyway)).
      The intention is that you should be able to open FileName for reading
      (or reading and writing; anyway, file contents should exist).

      if not OpenDialog: allows user to select a non-existent filename.
      Still, it may try to force ExtractFilePath(FileName) to be valid,
      i.e. user may be forced to choose only filenames with existing paths.
      (of course, here it may fail TOO. So you should not assume for sure
      that ExtractFilePath(FileName) is valid).
      Some warning to user may be shown if FileName already exists, like
      "are you sure you want to overwrite this file ?".
      The intention is that you should be able to open FileName for writing.
      This is the "Save File" dialog.

      Those dialog boxes may allow user for some additional actions,
      e.g. to create some directories, rename some files etc.

      FileFilters is a set of file filters to present to user.
      Pass @nil (default) if you do not want to use file file filters,
      so user will just always see everything. An overloaded version
      allows you to pass file filters encoded in a single string,
      this may be slightly more comfortable for call, see
      TFileFiltersList.AddFiltersFromString

    is often useful in some simple demo programs in OpenGL.
    I.e. features implemented here are nice and easy to use,
    but I think that if you're going to do some large program you may
    be better off implementing these things in some other place,
    or not using them at all.
    E.g. using this class, Escape key automatically causes closing
    the window. This is nice if your program is a simple OpenGL toy,
    but this may not be so useful if you're doing a really big game
    and you don't want to allow user to close the window by simply
    pressing one key.

  { OpenGL window keeping a @link(Controls) list. This allows you to
    trivially add to the window any TUIControl descendants.

    If UseControls, we pass our inputs (mouse / key events) to the top-most
    (that is, first on the @link(Controls) list) control under the current mouse position
    (we check control's PositionInside method for this).
    As long as the event is not handled,
    we look for next controls under the mouse position.
    Only if no control handled the event, we pass it to the inherited
    EventXxx method, which calls normal window callbacks OnKeyDown etc.

    We also call other methods on every control (if UseControls),
    like TUIControl.Idle, TUIControl.Draw2D, TUIControl.WindowResize.

    We use OnVisibleChange event of our controls to make
    PostRedisplay when something visible changed. If you want to use
    OnVisibleChange for other purposes, you can reassign OnVisibleChange
    yourself. This window will only change OnVisibleChange from @nil
    to it's own internal callback (when adding a control),
    and from it's own internal callback to @nil (when removing a control).
    This means that if you assign OnVisibleChange callback to your own
    method --- window will not touch it anymore.

    TCamera descendants can be treated like any other TUIControl,
    that is you can add them directly to the @link(Controls) list.
    But, if you use only one camera (most common situation),
    you can also assign it to the @link(Camera) property
    (this will cause appropriate add / replace / remove on
    the @link(Controls) list). }

          OpenGL projection matrix is not modified (so projection

          This is suitable if you want to draw something over other

    { OnIdle bedzie wywolywane gdy window system nie przesle nam zadnych
      message'ow i w zwiazku z tym bedziemy wolni. Naczelnym celem
      OnIdle jest aby w aplikacji zmuszonej do czestego odmalowywania sie
      na ekranie OnIdle bylo wykonywane mniej wiecej tak czesto co OnDraw
      (tzn. nie 1 do 1, ale proporcjonalnie tak czesto). W zwiazku z tym
      jezeli nie mamy do siebie zadnych message'ow ale musimy sie
      odmalowac to wtedy OnIdle ZOSTANIE wywolane (nie wiem czy tak
      jest pod glutem; chyba pod glutem OnIdle jest wywolane tylko
      gdy nie musielismy sie odmalowac czyli potencjalnie OnIdle
      moze wtedy zachodzic za rzadko).

      Wiec jesli w kolko mamy posylane do siebie zdarzenia OnDrawGL -
      to pomiedzy nimi zawsze zmieszcza sie z pewna czestotliwoscia
      zdarzenia OnIdleGL. Jednoczesnie, nie odmalowujemy sie w kazdym
      obrocie petli - odmalowujemy sie tylko gdy nie mamy do siebie
      zadnych zdarzen (to tak jak glut; jest faktem ze jezeli
      aplikacja nie nadaza z przetwarzaniem nadchodzacych message'y
      to nalezy cala sile skupic na ich przetwarzaniu a nie
      utrudniac sobie prace zmuszajac sie do przemalowywania okienka
      mimo ze mamy jakies message'y do obsluzenia).

      W szczegolnosci, to jest odpowiednie miejsce aby robic
      badanie Pressed[] klawiszy (chyba ze nasluch na OnKeyDown wystarcza),
      robic animacje zmieniajac jakies zmienne i wywolywac PostRedisplay.

      Mozesz tez zmieniac wartosc tej  zmiennej w czasie dzialania programu

      ze czas jaki uplynal pomiedzy kolejnymi OnTimer jest duzo wiekszy -
      - w szczegolnosci, OnTimer realizowany jest w ProcessMessage wiec
      musisz zadbac aby ProcessMessage bylo wykonywane dosc czesto w czasie
      i aby pozostale callbacki nie zajmowaly zbyt duzo czasu.
      Jesli ustawisz za male TimerMilisec to OnTimer zacznie dzialac jak OnIdle !
      Mozesz tez zmieniac wartosc OnTimer i TimerMilisec w czasie dzialania engine'u
      (tzn.pomiedzy Init a Close jakiegos okienka). }

    property TimerMilisec: Cardinal read FTimerMilisec write FTimerMilisec; { = 1000 }

    { Przetwarzaj pewna ilosc messagy WindowSystemu (moze zero, moze kilka ?)
      po drodze wywolujac OnDraw / Idle / Resize itd. w miare potrzeby
      dispatchujac odpowiednie messagy (a wiec i zdarzenia) do odpowiednich
      obiektow TGLWindow.

      Zwraca false jesli wywolano Quit (bezposrednio lub wywolujac
      Close na ostatnim okienku (Close tez mozna wywolac bezposrednio
      lub user moze kliknac na jakis przycisk "Zamknij"))
      Aplikacja chcaca cos robi w oczekiwaniu na zajscie warunku BB
      powinna robia tak :

      while not BB do Application.ProcessMessages;

      W GLWindow, inaczej niz w jakims wiekszym systemie jak np. VCL czy WinAPI,
      programista ma prosta i pelna kontrole nad programem, wic mona bez problemu
      napisa program tak, eby bylo jasne i w danym stanie programu uzytkownik
      nie moe spowodowa wywolania procedury QuitGL. Przed taka ptla naley
      wic wprowadzi program w taki stan e prdzej czy pzniej MUSI zajs
      BB, a potem go z tego stanu wyprowadzi.

      Gdyby jednak moliwos zakocenia programu w takiej ptli byla dopuszczona,
      nalealoby napisa ptl postaci

      while not BB do
       if not Application.ProcessMessage then break;

      Co mozna zakladac lub nie o dzialaniu petli ProcessGLWinMessages ?
       - jezeli windManager zasypuje nam message'ami moze sie okazac
         ze od czasu wywolania PostRedisplay do czasu wywolania
         OnDraw minelo duzo wywolan ProcessMessage. To dlatego ze
         ProcessMessage nie wywoluje zadnego OnDraw jesli ma message
         do przetworzenia. Nie wywoluje tez OnIdle jesli ma message
         do przetworzenia. Natomiast jezeli nie ma message jest
         gwarantowane ze OnDraw i OnIdle beda wywolywane mniej
         wiecej proporcjonalnie tyle samo razy (no chyba ze,
         oczywiscie, PostRedisplay nie bedzie wywolywany co petle).
         Patrz komentarz przy OnIdle.
       - ProcessMessage moze zdecydowac, o ile AllowSuspend i OnIdleGL = nil
         i jeszcze kilka innych warunkow, ze jezeli events queue z WindowSystemu
         jest pusta to zaczekamy az WindowSystem przysle nam jakis event -
         ale nie przez krecenie sie w kolko robiac "puste" wykonania ProcessMessage
         (czyli powodujac zle busy-waiting) tylko przekazujac informacje do
         systemu ze "nasz proces czeka na event". Np. pod Xlib robimy
         XNextEvent, pod Windows GetMessage. W rezultacie piszac petle
         while ProcessMessage(true) do foo(); NIE MOZESZ zakladac
         ze foo() jest wywolywane co chwila. Jezeli OnIdleGL = nil to
         pomiedzy kolejnymi wywolaniami foo() moze uplynac wiele czasu
         bezczynosci naszego programu.
       - robiac normalna petle programu w rodzaju
         "while ProcessMessage(true) do ;" jak w TGLWindowManager.Run
         bedziesz podawal AllowSuspend = true, bo skoro jedynym sensem
         petli jest wykonywanie ProcessMessage to nie przeszkadza nam fakt
         ze ProcessMessage moze zawisnac.

         Robiac petle w rodzaju tej w ProgressGL czy RaytraceToWindow (w czasie
         wykonywania renderowania) bedziesz chcial miec AllowSuspend = false
         bo bedziesz chcial zeby ProcessMessage uaktualnilo okienko i zakonczylo sie
         najszybciej jak to mozliwe abys mogl kontyuowac obliczenia.

         Robiac petle w rodzaju tej w GLWinMessages albo RaytraceToWindow
         (juz PO zakonczeniu renderowania) postaci
         "repeat ProcessMessage(true) until B;" gdzie B to zmienna/funkcja
         boolowska musisz sie zastonowic : czy zmiana wartosci B MUSI byc
         zwiazana z zajsciem jakiegos callbacka (czyli z zajsciem jakiegos
         zdarzenia dla window managera) ? Jesli tak to mozesz spokojnie
         dac AllowSuspend. Jesli nie, np. stan B zmienia sie w czasie bez
         posrednictwa twojego programu (np. B = function IsUserHungry)
         to musisz dac AllowSuspend = false.

         User is always hungry.

         ProcessAllMessages wywoluje w petli ProcessMessage(false, WasAnyMessage)
         i konczy gdy ProcessMessage zwrocilo false lub WasAnyMessage = false.
         ProcessAllMessages robi wiec jakby flush - synchronizuje nas z window
         managerem, upewniajac sie ze przetworzylismy WSZYSTKIE message'y jakie
         mielismy do wykonania. ProcessAllMessages jest uzyteczne gdy robimy
         cos chcac co jakis czas wywolywac ProcessMessage i chcemy byc pewni
         ze przetwarzamy wszystkie message'y od window managera (ze jestesmy
         na biezaco) - bo byc moze np. jezeli user przycisnie Escape to chcemy
         zrezygnowac z robienia dlugo trwajacej rzeczy. W ten sytuacji robienie
         tylko ProcessMessage co jakis czas nie jest wystarczajaco dobrym pomyslem
         bo np. gdy user przesunie myszke my dostaniemy mnostwo message'y mouseMove
         i jezeli potem user przycisnie Escape to my DLUGO DLUGO tego nie zauwazymy
         bo bedziemy przetwarzali zdarzenia mouseMove. W rezultacie bedziemy
         kontynuowali obliczenia mimo ze user wcisnal Escape. Zle ! Chcemy byc
         na biezaco z message'ami jezeli zamierzamy na nie reagowac.
         Wiec wtedy mozna uzyc ProcessAllMessages - wywoluj to co jakis czas
         i wtedy masz pewnosc ze jestes na biezaco z window managerem.
         Przyklad uzycia : RaytraceToWindow w view3dscene.
         Nigdy nie wywoluj ProcessAllMessages w petli (powinienes wtedy uzywac
         ProcessMessage) - uzywaj tego tylko jesli robisz duzo rzeczy pomiedzy
         kolejnymi wywolaniami ProcessAllMessages.

      Note that if you let some exception to be raised out of
      some event (like OnXxx) then this window may be closed
      while recovering from this exception. I.e. GLWindow implementation
      is free to implement part of ProcessMessage like
      @longCode(#
        if HasKeyDown then
        try
          OnKeyDown(...);
        except
          Close;
          raise;
        end;
      #)
      TODO: this behavior is currently done only by Xlib and WinAPI

      Close (or Application.Quit) from your window OnInit / OnResize callback.
      In such case no event would probably reach

   3) XWindow-Managerem ktory zawsze moze nas zresizowac, mimo ze prosimy go
      zeby tego nie robil.
   wiec pod wszystkimi trzema implementacjami musimy sprawdzic warunek ze
     albo ResizeAllowed = raAllowed albo naprawde fwidth = w itd.
   Sprawdzamy tez czy w i h sa w odpowiednim zakresie minXxx .. maxXxx.
     Oczywiscie implementacje powinny starac sie zeby nic spoza tego zakresu do nas
     nie dotarlo, ale nigdy nie ma pewnosci. Zwracam uwage, ze wymagamy aby zawsze
     minWidth > 0 i minHeight > 0 wiec jednoczesnie ponizej gwarantujemy sobie ze nie
     zachodzi sytuacja w = 0 lub h = 0.

   Apropos wywolywania DoResize(.., false) z InitImplDepend:
   zabezpieczamy sie przed tym zawsze. Ale mozna tu odnotowac ze z pewnoscia

   implementacji WINAPI i GTK.

  { Initially I was doing here UpdateMouseLook, and within UpdateMouseLook:

      if MouseLookActive then
        SetMousePosition(Width div 2, Height div 2);

    but this bites us when we're doing UpdateMouseLook automatically,
    because often MouseLookActive is true for a very short time.

    For example, consider castle, where MouseLook is usually true
    during the game, but it's off in game menu (TGLMenu) and start screen.
    So when you're in the game, and choose "End game", game menu
    closes (immediately bringing back MouseLook = true by TGLMode.Destroy
    restoring everything), but game mode immediately closes and goes
    back to start screen. Effect: mouse cursor is forced to the middle
    of the screen, without any apparent (for user) reason.

    While we could argue that this is an error of the "castle" game
    (as, in fact, mouse look was temporarily true) but fixing this
    in "castle" would be a major pain.
    (And making UpdateMouseLook automatic was, after all,
    to make things work smoothly without any painful bookkeeping.)

    So it's not a comfortable behavior to reset mouse position to screen
    middle too aggressively. So don't do it. This requires the MouseMove
    handler to only work when initial mouse position is at the screen middle,
    otherwise initial mouse look would generate large move.
    But in fact TWalkCamera.MouseMove already does this, so it's all Ok. }

 { Instead of using FreeAndNil, just call Free.
   In our constructor we take care of setting Application variable to @nil,
   when it becomes really useless.

   Otherwise FreeAndNil first nils, then frees Application, and we really
   want to keep Application during first stage of TGLApplication destruction:
   when calling Quit, which may close windows, which may use Application
   variable in their Close or CloseImplDepend implementations. }
 Application.Free;
 Assert(Application = nil);

 { Order is important: GLWindowMenu_Fini frees MenuItems, which is needed
   by TMenu destructor. And some TGLWindow instances may be freed
   only by Application destructor (when they are owned by Application). }
