    These members work regardless if you use CastleWindow or CastleControl.

    or Lazarus (LCL) TApplication (in case you use CastleControl). }

    { Callbacks called when the OpenGL context is opened or closed.
      Use when you want to be notified about OpenGL context availability,
      but cannot refer to a particular instance of TCastleControl or TCastleWindow.

      Note that we may have many OpenGL contexts (many
      TCastleWindow or TCastleControl instances) open simultaneously.
      They all share OpenGL resources.
      OnGLContextOpen is called when first OpenGL context is open,
      that is: no previous context was open.
      OnGLContextClose is called when last OpenGL context is closed,
      that is: no more contexts remain open.
      Note that this implies that they may be called many times:
      e.g. if you open one window, then close it, then open another
      window then close it.

      Callbacks on OnGLContextOpen are called from first to last.
      Callbacks on OnGLContextClose are called in reverse order,
      so OnGLContextClose[0] is called last.

      You can use this just like @link(TCastleControlCustom.OnUpdate)
      or @link(TCastleWindowCustom.OnUpdate) or @link(TCastleApplication.OnUpdate),
      but in situations where you cannot access an instance of control/window
      and you want to work both with Lazarus @link(TCastleControl)
      and our custom @link(TCastleApplication). }

    { Callbacks called when Android Java activity started.
      Called every time a Java activity is created.

      @unorderedList(
        @item(For the first time, it's called right before
          @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize).)

        @item(Later this is called when Java activity
          died (and is restarting now), but the native code thread survived.
          So all native code memory is already cool (no need to call
          @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize)),
          but we need to reinitialize Java part.

          Note that this is different from @link(TCastleWindowCustom.OnOpen).
          We lose OpenGL context often, actually every time user switches to another
          app, without having neither Java nor native threads killed.

      )

      For non-Android applications, this is simply always called exactly
      once, exactly before calling @link(TCastleApplication.OnInitialize). }
