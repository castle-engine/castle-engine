# Low-level Android integration code

Most of this code is a simple translation of Android NDK C headers to Pascal, and it was copies from Lazarus and cleaned up a little, see `trunk/lcl/interfaces/customdrawn/android/` in Lazarus sources.

Since then we've done quite a few changes to this in Castle Game Engine.
