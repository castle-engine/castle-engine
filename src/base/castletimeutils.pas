  { Time in seconds. This is used throughout my engine to represent time
    as a floating-point value with good accuracy in seconds.
    In particular, for VRML / X3D time-dependent nodes.

    Implementation notes, about the choice of precision:

    @unorderedList(
      @item("Single" precision is sometimes @italic(not) enough for this.
        Proof: open rotate.kanim (from demo_models).
        Change "on display" time pass to 1000, wait a couple seconds
        (world time will reach a couple of thousands),
        change "on display" time pass back to 1.
        Result: with time as Single, animation becomes jagged.
        Reason: the precision loss of Single time, and the fact that
        Render is not called all the time (because AutoRedisplay is false,
        and model is in Examine mode and is still (not rotating)),
        so incrementation steps of AnimationTime are very very small.

        Setting AutoRedisplay to true workarounds the problem too, but that's
        1. unacceptable to eat 100% CPU without a reason for utility like
        view3dscene 2. that's asking for trouble, after all even with
        AutoRedisplay = true the precision loss is there, it's just not
        noticeable... using better precision feels much safer.)

      @item(For X3D, SFTime has "Double" precision.
        Also "The Castle" and "The Rift" prooved it's enough in practice.

        I could have choosen Extended here,
        but for X3D sake (to avoid unnecessary floating-point conversions
        all around), let's stick to Double for now.)

{ Check is SecondTime larger by at least TimeDelay than FirstTime.

  Simple implementation of this would be @code(SecondTime - FirstTime >= TimeDelay).

  FirstTime and SecondTime are milisecond times from some initial point.
  For example, they may be taken from a function like 32-bit GetTickCount
  (on older Windows; on newer we use GetTickCount64).
  Such time may "wrap".
  This function checks these times intelligently, using the assumption that
  the SecondTime is always "later" than the FirstTime, and only having to check
  if it's later by at least TimeDelay.

  Always TimeTickSecond(X, X, 0) = @true. that is, when both times
  are actually equal, it's correctly "later by zero miliseconds". }
function TimeTickSecondLater(const FirstTime, SecondTime, TimeDelay: TMilisecTime): boolean;

{ Difference in times between SecondTime and FirstTime.

  Naive implementation would be just @code(SecondTime - FirstTime),
  this function does a little better: takes into account that times may "wrap"
  (see TimeTickSecondLater), and uses the assumption that
  the SecondTime for sure "later", to calculate hopefully correct difference. }

  These don't care if TMilisecTime is a point in time, or time interval.
  They simply add / subtract values. It's your problem if adding / subtracting
  them is sensible.

  Range checking is ignored. In particular, this means that if you subtract
  smaller value from larger value, the result will be like the time "wrapped"
  in between (since TMilisecTime range is limited).

  Note that using this is unsafe in libraries, not to mention multi-threaded
  programs (it's not "reentrant") --- you risk that some other code
  called ProcessTimerBegin, and your ProcessTimerEnd doesn't measure
  what you think. So in general units, do not use this, use ProcessTimerNow
  and ProcessTimerDiff instead. In final programs (when you have full control)
  using these is comfortable and Ok.

      like OnUpdate, and it doesn't take into account that frames are possibly
      not rendered continously (when AutoRedisplay = @false, we may render

      of EventRender (OnRender) calls per second. This means that it's actual
      speed of your program. Anything can slow this down, not only long
      EventRender (OnRender), but also slow processing of other events (like OnUpdate).
      Also, when AutoRedisplay = @false, this may be very low, since you

      The time is in seconds, 1.0 = 1 second.

      for two times slower UpdateSecondsPassed = 2.0. This is useful for doing
      time-based rendering, when you want to scale some changes
      by computer speed, to get perceived animation speed the same on every
      computer, regardless of computer's speed.

      This is calculated as a time between
      start of previous Update event and start of current Update event.
      So this really measures your whole loop time (unlike previous RenderSpeed
      that measured only EventRender (OnRender) speed).

      This is useful if you just came back from some lenghty
      state, like a GUI dialog box (like TCastleWindowCustom.FileDialog or modal boxes
      in CastleMessages --- but actually all our stuff already calls this
      as needed, TGLMode takes care of this). UpdateSecondsPassed would be ridicoulously
      long in such case (if our loop is totally stopped) or not relevant
      (if we do our loop, but with totally different callbacks, like
      CastleMessages). Instead, it's most sensible in such case to fake
      that UpdateSecondsPassed is 0.0, so things such as TCastleSceneCore.Time
      should not advance wildly just because we did GUI box.

      This forces the UpdateSecondsPassed to zero only once, that is only on the
      next update event (_UpdateBegin). Following update event (_UpdateBegin) will have
      UpdateSecondsPassed as usual (unless you call ZeroNextSecondsPassed again, of course). }

      Changed when each container "update" event occurs,

      @link(TUIControl.Render), @link(T3D.Update),
      @link(T3D.Render) occuring within the same frame.
      You can use this to avoid performing the same job many times
      in a single frame.

      Never zero.

      It's a class function, so you can access it like
      @code(TFramesPerSecond.FrameId),
      no need to have a TFramesPerSecond instance (which is usually
