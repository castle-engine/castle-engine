This directory contains very small applications, included from the API documentation (using PasDoc @includeCode) to demonstate some function.

These are deliberately small programs, and usually will work only on a desktop (not mobile) because they don't use the cross-platform approach of having a `GameInitialize` unit (and letting _Castle Game Engine_ build tool to generate automatic program/library to run it). These examples just have a main program that does everything (which only works on desktop).

You should be able to easily copy-paste these examples into larger cross-platform applications.
