# Physics: Persistent Forces Components

This example contains components that perform "persistent" forces, like pulling / pushing all the rigid bodies in the world. They are similar to [Blender Force Fields](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/physics/forces/force_fields/index.html).

TODO:

- Improve the demo to be more self-explanatory what is happening. Do not show multiple components in one 2D design.

- Add docs to components.

- Consider upgrading some of these components to be part of the engine.

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

## Building

Compile by:

- [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/editor). Just use menu items _"Compile"_ or _"Compile And Run"_.

- Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.

- Or use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). Open in Lazarus `physics_tests_standalone.lpi` file and compile / run from Lazarus. Make sure to first register [CGE Lazarus packages](https://castle-engine.io/lazarus).
