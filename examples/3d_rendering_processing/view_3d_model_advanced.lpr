    { camera is separate from the 3D world, and so it is *not* reinitialized
      by simple reloading of the scene. In this demo, we want to move camera
      to most suitable place for the *new* scene (ignoring previous camera
      mode and position). The simplest way to do it is to just free the previous
      camera. SceneManager will automatically create new, suitable camera
      before next render. }

  { Enable rendering models using shadow volumes. This requires some special
    code, as OpenGL must be prepared in a special way to enable it,
    and some GPUs (really ancient ones) may simply not support it.
    See http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/x3d_extensions.php#section_ext_shadows
    for documentation how to prepare your model to have shadow volumes,
    and for links to demo models using shadow volumes.

    Note that for (really really old) GPUs that don't support stencil buffer,
    our Window.Open call will automatically turn StencilBits to 0 and fallback
    to OpenGL context without shadow volumes. }
