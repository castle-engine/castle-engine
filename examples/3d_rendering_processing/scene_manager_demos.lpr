{ Demo of using SceneManager. Shows how you can add many 3D objects to
  SceneManager.Items tree. For simpler usage,
  see simplest_vrml_browser.lpr first.

  This reads a couple of 3D files from models/ subdirectory.
  Their URLs are in the source code below.
  Do not hesitate to experiment, just replace URLs of the 3D models
  with your own, and generally experiment freely with this program :)

    dynamic scene (ssDynamicCollisions) and frustum culling
    optimization when rendering (ssRendering). }

    presses, processing VRML/X3D script nodes etc. }

  { add Scene to SceneManager }
  { Add your scene to SceneManager.Items. This is essential,
    it makes the scene actually rendered, animated etc. }
  Window.SceneManager.Items.Add(Scene);
  { Set the scene as SceneManager.MainScene. This is optional
    (you do have to set SceneManager.MainScene), but usually desired.
    MainScene is used in various moments when we need a single designated 3D
    object to do some task. For example, default camera location is taken
    from Viewpoint VRML/X3D node inside the MainScene. }

  { To have some more fun with SceneManager, let's add more 3D objects to it.
    Let's suppose we want to have SceneManager.Items to be a tree:

    SceneManager.Items
    |- Scene (class TCastleScene)
    |- ParticlesTransform (class T3DTransform)
       |- ParticlesScene (class TCastleScene)
    |- DinoTransform (class T3DTransform)
       |- DinoScene (class TCastleScene)
  }

  { initialize ParticlesScene }
  ParticlesScene := TCastleScene.Create(Application);
  ParticlesScene.Load('models/castle_script_particles.x3dv');
  ParticlesScene.Spatial := [ssRendering, ssDynamicCollisions];
  { Modify the loaded nodes graph, just to show that we can.
    We find a node called ParticleScript, and change it's "count" field.
    This affects the number of particles generated.
    We change it before the animation even starts (before activating ProcessEvents). }
  ParticleScript := ParticlesScene.RootNode.FindNodeByName(
    TScriptNode, 'ParticleScript', true) as TScriptNode;
  (ParticleScript.Fields.ByName['count'] as TSFInt32).Send(100);
  ParticlesScene.ProcessEvents := true;
  ParticlesTransform.Add(ParticlesScene);

  { initialize DinoTransform }
  DinoTransform := T3DTransform.Create(Application);
  DinoTransform.Translation := Vector3Single(-20, -1, -2);
  Window.SceneManager.Items.Add(DinoTransform);

  { initialize DinoScene }
  DinoScene := TCastleScene.Create(Application);
  DinoScene.Load('models/raptor.kanim');
  DinoScene.ProcessEvents := true;
  DinoScene.Spatial := [ssRendering, ssDynamicCollisions];
  { render wireframe over a normal model. See TWireframeEffect docs
    for other options.  }
