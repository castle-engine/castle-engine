# Terrain editing in game

Show terrain editing using Castle Game Engine UI, that can be utilized within any Castle Game Engine application on any platform.

This allows players to e.g. terraform the world.

Note that for usual terrain editing in games, you rather use the _"Edit Terrain"_ feature in Castle Game Engine editor. This actually uses the same mechanism underneath.

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).
