# Build a 2D rectangle, keep updating it to show a bounding rectangle of another 2D scene

This is a fully flexible approach to show a 2D or 3D bounding volume. You control exactly how the visualization looks.

Note: You can also visualize 3D bounding box easier using ready `TDebugTransformBox` or `TDebugTransform` from `CastleDebugTransform`.

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

## Building

Compile by:

- [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/editor). Just use menu items _"Compile"_ or _"Compile And Run"_.

- Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.

- Or use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). Open in Lazarus `multiple_viewports_standalone.lpi` file and compile / run from Lazarus. Make sure to first register [CGE Lazarus packages](https://castle-engine.io/lazarus).
