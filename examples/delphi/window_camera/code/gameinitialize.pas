initialization
  { This initialization section configures:
    - Application.OnInitialize
    - Application.MainWindow
    - determines initial window size

    You should not need to do anything more in this initialization section.
    Most of your actual application initialization (in particular, any file reading)
    should happen inside ApplicationInitialize. }

  Application.OnInitialize := {$ifdef FPC}@{$endif} ApplicationInitialize;

  Window := TCastleWindow.Create(Application);
  Application.MainWindow := Window;

  { On desktops, use a window with portrait proportions,
    as this example is designed for mobile devices in portrait orientation.
    See https://castle-engine.io/window_size . }
  Window.Width := 450;
  Window.Height := 800;

  { Handle command-line parameters like --fullscreen and --window.
    By doing this last, you let user to override your fullscreen / mode setup. }
