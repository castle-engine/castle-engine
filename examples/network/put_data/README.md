# Send PUT request with some body using TCastleDownload

Demonstrates using `TCastleDownload` to send HTTP PUT request with some body.

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

Handling PUT on a server side: This is the most trivial PHP script to do it: https://github.com/castle-engine/cge-www/blob/master/htdocs/miscella/test_put.php .

## Building

Compile by:

- [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/editor). Just use menu items _"Compile"_ or _"Compile And Run"_.

- Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.

- Or use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). Open in Lazarus `put_data.lpi` file and compile / run from Lazarus. Make sure to first register [CGE Lazarus packages](https://castle-engine.io/lazarus).

- Or use [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/Delphi). Open in Delphi `put_data.dproj` file and compile / run from Delphi. See [CGE and Delphi](https://castle-engine.io/delphi) documentation for details.
