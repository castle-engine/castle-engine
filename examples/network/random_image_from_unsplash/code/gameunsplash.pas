      This id can also be used as any unique id for your own purpses.
      It contains only safe characters,so can be used even as filename/URL part,
      e.g. you can save it as @code('castle-config:/' + UnsplashImageId + '.jpg').

      whether UnsplashImageId is really safe, before doing such thing. ) }
