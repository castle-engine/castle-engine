Test reading filenames with local (non-ASCII) characters.
Once executed you should just get a trivial window with text "All tests executed OK :)".

Additional things you may want to test:
- It works even if your username contains local characters.
- It works even if parent directory contains local characters.
- It works even if exe name contains local characters.

It should work on all OSes, all FPC versions.
