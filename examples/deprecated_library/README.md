# Examples using CGE as a dynamic library to load and visualize 3D models

These examples show usage of CGE dynamic library to load and render 3D files.
The library itself is in `../../src/deprecated_library`.

To be able to run these examples you should first compile the library following `../../src/deprecated_library/README.md` .
( On some systems, like Unix, you need to compile the library even before *linking* the example, as shared library must exist already at link time. )

These examples are deprecated, just as the library `../../src/deprecated_library` is deprecated. See `../../src/deprecated_library/README.md` for more information.
