# Custom Component in CGE editor

You can define custom components, specific to your project, that are available inside [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php):

- Define a new component by creating a class descending from `TComponent`. You will usually want to descend from CGE class like `TCastleUserInterface` (to make new UI components) or `TCastleTransform` (to make new things that can be put inside a viewport).

    The `code/gamecontrols.pas` unit here demonstrates this by defininig `TImageGrid`.

- Register your component using `RegisterSerializableComponent`.

- Set `editor_units` in `CastleEngineManifest.xml` to include the unit with your components.

- Run the custom version of the editor, with your custom components, using _"Project -> Restart Editor (With Custom Components)"_ from the normal editor.

- Done. Use the new component as a regular component.

    In this example, we placed `TImageGrid` in our main design, `data/gameviewmain.castle-user-interface`.

See https://castle-engine.io/custom_components for more information how you can extend custom components to look great in CGE editor.

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

## Building

Compile by:

- [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/editor). Just use menu items _"Compile"_ or _"Compile And Run"_.

- Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.

- Or use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). Open in Lazarus `custom_component_standalone.lpi` file and compile / run from Lazarus. Make sure to first register [CGE Lazarus packages](https://castle-engine.io/lazarus).

- Or use [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/Delphi). Open in Delphi `custom_component_standalone.dproj` file and compile / run from Delphi. See [CGE and Delphi](https://castle-engine.io/delphi) documentation for details.
