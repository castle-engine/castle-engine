{ Process arbitrary model for PRT. Computes and adds "radianceTransfer"
  field to all geometry nodes (descending from X3DComposedGeometryNode,
  this includes most often used nodes).

  $1 is the source model, $2 is the output model (output is always VRML/X3D,
  so use .wrl/.x3dv extension).

  --sh-basis-count / -c COUNT

    Says how much basis SH functions to use. PRT paper advices between
    9 and 25.

  --rays-per-vertex / -r COUNT

    How many rays per vertex to generate. This linearly affects the speed
    of the program. Default if 1000, PRT paper advices 10 * 1000 to 30 * 1000
    for best effect.

  TODO: for now, radianceTransfer is calculated for whole model.
  This means that self-shadowing takes whole model into account,
  but also that whole model must remain static (or radianceTransfer must
  be animated along with coords).

  Alternative approach is possible: calculate radianceTransfer only
  for this specific shape. Then shape must stay static (or it's
  radianceTransfer must be animated along with it's coords), but it can
  move with respect to other shapes. But note that then self-shadowing
  takes only this shape into account... TODO: make this possible,
  and document on x3d_extensions.

  We compute radianceTransfer in scene space (not in local shape
  space). This is important, otherwise incoming light SH (calculated
  when rendering at every frame) would have to be transformed (rotated)
  for each shape. Right now, it only has to be rotated once, for each scene.

  Note that your geometry nodes shouldn't use DEF/USE mechanism.
  If the same shape is instantiated many times, it will have the same
  radianceTransfer. Which is bad, since self-shadowing may be different
  on different instances...
  TODO: move to x3d_extensions docs.

              RayDirection to RayDirectionPT, to get RayDirectionPT in world coords.
              This is an extremely important operation, without this SHBasis
              is calculated with wrong arguments, and the models are
              not lighted as they should with PRT. }
