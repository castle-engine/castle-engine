  Define the "Knight" creature properties. See
  http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/creating_data_resources.php
  for extensive documentation of available properties, in short:

  - name: used to refer to this creature from ObjectPascal code,
    e.g. in Resources.FindName('Knight').
    Also to create placeholders to place initial creatures of this kind on level:
    (place on the level, in Blender, object named 'CasResKnight').

  - type: indicates ObjectPascal class used to handle this creature,
    in this case TWalkAttackCreatureResource (and the
    TWalkAttackCreatureResource, in turn, indicates that particular creature
    on level will use TWalkAttackCreature class).
    This is an intelligent walking-attacking creature.

  - model: animations 3D models. There are many ways to define them,
    in this case we use castle-anim-frames.
    We export animations from Blender to castle-anim-frames using our exporter on
    http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/castle_animation_frames.php .

  - radius and preferred_height: important for collision detection.
    These are best visualized with "Render debug 3D" in fps_game.
    See T3D.Sphere and T3D.Middle and T3D.PreferredHeight documentation for
    a precise meaning of these values. Engine *does* calculate good values
    for them automatically, but they can be "tuned" manually to work even better
    (that is because the engine does not know that these are humanoids,
    and so their head is quite high in all animation states (aside from "die")).

<resource
  name="Knight"
  type="WalkAttack"
  middle_height="0.75"
  radius="0.5"
  preferred_distance="3.5"
  move_speed="1.75"
>
  <model>
    <idle   url="idle.castle-anim-frames"  />
    <walk   url="walk.castle-anim-frames"  />
    <attack url="attack.castle-anim-frames"/>
    <die    url="die.castle-anim-frames"   />
    <hurt   url="hurt.castle-anim-frames"  />
  </model>

  <!-- Note that time="xxx" attribute should be synchronized with attack.castle-anim-frames
       animation specified above to look good. This is the time during animation
       when the actual "hit" (life loss, pain, knockback, and so on) occurs.
       So this should be synchronized to occur when visually the sword falls
       down on the player. -->
  <attack max_distance="4.0" knockback_distance="4.0" time="0.5">
    <!-- Note that by default damage is 0, so player doesn't lose Life,
         so we will not even show the "pain" FadeOut. -->
    <damage const="1" random="1" />
  </attack>
</resource>
