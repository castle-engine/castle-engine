  Define the level properties. See
  https://github.com/castle-engine/cge-www/blob/master/htdocs/doc/obsolete/deprecated_3d_game_utilities/creating_data_levels.php
  for extensive documentation of available properties, in short:

  - name: used to refer to this level from ObjectPascal code,
    e.g. in TLevel.Load(...)

  - type: indicates ObjectPascal class used to handle this level logic,
    usually just 'Level' to use standard TLevelLogic class.
  - scene: 3D model filename.

  - loading_image: Image to show under a progress bar when loading level.
    You can show here anything you like (e.g. many games show a screenshot
    from the level, sometimes blurred). You don't have to specify this image,
    then progress background will simply show whatever was displayed
    in the viewport when level loading started.

  - <prepare_resources> should list resources used by this level.
    These resources will be prepared during TLevel.Load call.
    "Resources" refers to creatures and items (and potentially other types
    of resources you define in your game), although in this special case
    you do not have to list items: all items are (by default)
    always prepared before loading a level (because player can potentially
    carry an item from one level and drop it on another level).

    So, practically: list here just creatures that are potentially used
    on the level. This includes creatures initially present on the level
    (placed there by placeholders), or added later on the level by any means
    (e.g. by creating the creature and adding it to level by ObjectPascal code,
    see TCreatureResource.CreateCreature method).

    It is not strictly necessary to list here all used creatures:
    not listed creatures will be prepared "on demand" (when they appear
    on level). But this "on demand" loading is somewhat bad for player,
    as (s)he sees a progress bar in the middle of the game.
    Keeping all possible creatures already prepared avoids this.
