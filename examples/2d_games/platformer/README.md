## Features

A complete demo of a platformer game, with

- Level (and all UI) designed visually using the editor.

- Sprites sheets designed using CGE editor and managed in .castle-sprite-sheet format (see [sprite sheets docs](https://castle-engine.io/sprite_sheets)).

- Full platformer gameplay. Player can move, jump, pick up a weapon, be hurt by enemies, be hurt by obstacles, collect things, die, finish the level. Extra jumps in the air are possible (check out _Advanced player_ checkbox). Enemies move following a simple pattern.

- Sound and music.

- All UI states you expect from a usual game â€” main menu, options (with volume configuration), pause, credits, game over and of course the actual game.

## Keys, mouse, touch input

You can use keys, mouse or touch (on mobile) input to fully control the game. On mobile, multi-touch works, so you can e.g. move left and jump at the same time.

- Move left: "A" key, or "left arrow" key, or press mouse/finger in the left-bottom screen part.

- Move right: "D" key, or "right arrow" key, or press mouse/finger in the right-bottom screen part.

- Jump: "W" key, or "up arrow" key, or press mouse/finger in the upper screen part.

- Shoot: "Space" key, or press right mouse button, or press at least 2 fingers on the touch device.
