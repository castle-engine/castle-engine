# 2D Games Demos

These "game demos" show a number of engine features used together to create a game... or at least a start of a game :)

We also want these demos to feature decent graphics and audio, composed from [open-source assets](https://castle-engine.io/assets.php).

Feel free to use these demos, just like any other engine examples, as a starting point for your own projects. The [examples are licensed on very permissive BSD license](https://castle-engine.io/license) so it's OK to use them as a basis even if you develop proprietary closed-source applications. (Though some graphic assets have different licenses -- check the `AUTHORS.txt` files in `data` subdirectories.)
