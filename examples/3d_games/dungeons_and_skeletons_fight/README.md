# Fight skeletons, explore dungeons

## Introduction

FPS game where you shoot at skeletons and try to find dungeons exit. Enemy logic is configured using our TCastleMoveAttack.

## Features

This demonstrates creating a simple 3D FPS game, from start to finish. The level, creatures, and win/lose views have been done using:

- [Castle Game Engine editor](https://castle-engine.io/editor)

- [Blender](https://castle-engine.io/blender) (to design base level geometry)

- [Sketchfab](https://castle-engine.io/sketchfab) (to add additional props to the level)

- [Quaternius models](https://quaternius.com/) (to add animated enemies)

- [TCastleMoveAttack component](https://castle-engine.io/apidoc/html/CastleLivingBehaviors.TCastleMoveAttack.html) (for ready logic of moving enemies and player hit points),

- `TCastleWalkNavigation` (for ready handling of AWSD and similar keys, typical for FPS games).

Controls:

- Walk using AWSD keys,
- rotate by holding _right mouse button_ and moving the mouse,
- shoot by clicking with _left mouse button_.

The Pascal code (most in `GameViewMain` unit) adds logic to

- Activate _mouse look_ when right mouse button is pressed,

- Show "game win" view when player reaches a certain place in the level,

- Show "game over (lost)" view when player life drops to zero,

- Show player life (hit points),

- Shoot enemy on mouse click.

- Follow [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/) tutorials and manual.

- See other examples included in the engine, like [examples/creature_behaviors](https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/creature_behaviors) that show other features, e.g. how to visualize getting hit by "temporary fade to red".

## Building

Compile by:

- [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/editor). Just use menu items _"Compile"_ or _"Compile And Run"_.

- Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.

- Or use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). Open in Lazarus `game_3d_standalone.lpi` file and compile / run from Lazarus. Make sure to first register [CGE Lazarus packages](https://castle-engine.io/lazarus).

- Or use [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/Delphi). Open in Delphi `game_3d_standalone.dproj` file and compile / run from Delphi. See [CGE and Delphi](https://castle-engine.io/delphi) documentation for details.
