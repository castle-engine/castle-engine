<properties>
  <!--
  Make not-compressed and not-downscaled version in castle-image format
  of textures in quaternius/ (used for 3D).
  The castle-image format will load faster than anything else in CGE.

  Commented out:
  - the gain is very small
    (~5 secs loading textures in viewport PrepareResources with .castle-image,
    vs ~7.5 time with .png/.jpg)
  - while .castle-image file size is significant.
