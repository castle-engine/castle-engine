Load a creature modeled and animated in Blender through `resource.xml` .
See https://github.com/castle-engine/cge-www/blob/master/htdocs/doc/obsolete/deprecated_3d_game_utilities/creating_data_resources.php .

This demonstrates various ways of exporting animated 3D models
to Castle Game Engine, the same ("knight") creature is exported
in different ways:

- Single file for all animations (glTF, X3D, castle-anim-frames)

- Multiple files, different file for each animation (multiple X3D, multiple castle-anim-frames)

We declare them in resource.xml files with different names
("KnightSingleXThreeD", "KnightMultipleXThreeD", and so on)
so the engine (ObjectPascal code) sees them as different creature resources.
In a real game, you would choose just one approach to exporting,
and have a single creature named just "Knight".

## What is the best approach?

Single glTF file ( `data/knight_single_gltf/` ).
This works with latest Blender exporter to glTF out-of-the-box,
and gives the best performance and features.
