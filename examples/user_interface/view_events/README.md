## Building

Compile by:

- Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.

- Or use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). Open in Lazarus `view_events_standalone.lpi` file and compile / run from Lazarus. Make sure to first register [CGE Lazarus packages](https://castle-engine.io/lazarus).

- Or use [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/Delphi). Open in Delphi `view_events_standalone.dproj` file and compile / run from Delphi. See [CGE and Delphi](https://castle-engine.io/delphi) documentation for details.
