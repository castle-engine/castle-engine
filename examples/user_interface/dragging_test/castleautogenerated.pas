    Should be done after setting ApplicationProperties.ApplicationName/Version,
    since they are recorded in the first automatic log messages.

    Should be done after basic command-line parameters are parsed
    for standalone programs (when "not IsLibrary").
    This allows to handle --version and --help command-line parameters
    without any extra output on Unix, and to set --log-file . }
