# Test All State Events

Demo of various events (virtual methods you can override) of TCastleView.
These events allow to react to user input (like key press)
or do something continuosly (e.g. move some game creature).

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

## Building

Compile by:

- [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php). Just use menu item _"Compile"_.

- Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.

- Or use [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/). Open in Lazarus `test_all_state_events_standalone.lpi` file and compile / run from Lazarus. Make sure to first register [CGE Lazarus packages](https://castle-engine.io/documentation.php).
