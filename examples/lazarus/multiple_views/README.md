# Managing views (TCastleView) on TCastleControl

Demo of changing views on `TCastleControl`.

This example is for Lazarus (LCL) TCastleControl. Though the principle (API how to change views) works everywhere -- with any container, including Delphi VCL and FMX TCastleControl, and including TCastleWindow.

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

## Building

1. Install Lazarus packages following https://castle-engine.io/control_on_form .

2. Open this project in Lazarus and compile + run it from Lazarus, as usual Lazarus application.

    - Or use [CGE editor](https://castle-engine.io/editor). Just use menu item _"Compile"_ or _"Compile And Run"_.

    - Or use [CGE command-line build tool](https://castle-engine.io/build_tool). Run `castle-engine compile` in this directory.
