#
# FPC configuration file for Castle Game Engine.
# Pretty much normal configuration for people that like modern ObjectPascal
# and ObjFpc mode.
#
# Accepts two switches: DEBUG and RELEASE. If you don't define any of them
# debug and optimizing code will be done according to compiler defaults.
# Never define both of them.
#
# Accepts a switch CASTLE_ENGINE_PATHS_ALREADY_DEFINED:
# in this case we will assume that proper -Fu and -Fi, to provide
# paths for FPC to our units, have already been defined.
# This allows to call FPC from any directory (otherwise you have to call
# FPC from this directory, containing castle-fpc.cfg, to make relative paths
# here work).
#
# For alternative, more flexible compilation method use
# tools/build-tool/castle-engine.lpr
# [https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/wiki/Build-Tool] .
#

# output options -------------------------------------------------------------

# Show FPC logo (shows fpc version)
-l

# Show warnings + notes.
# Do not show hints (there are too many useless hints produced by FPC).
-vwn

# Input/output checks always, even in release version.
# Some code may depend on the fact that IO errors in standard Pascal
# functions are checked automatically (and raise exceptions
# if SysUtils is compiled in). Although 99% of code should use TStream
# instead of old Pascal IO, and then this switch doesn't matter.
-Ci

# do not show Warning: (2045) APPTYPE is not supported by the target OS
-vm2045
# do not show Hint: (5024) Parameter "..." not used
-vm5024
# do not show
#   Warning: Implicit string type conversion from "AnsiString" to "WideString"
#   Warning: Implicit string type conversion from "AnsiString" to "UnicodeString"
# As we normally use AnsiString, and we deal with XML units
# (using WideString / UnicodeString), this is normal situation for us.
#-vm4105 # not available in FPC 2.6.4
# do not show
#   Warning: Implicit string type conversion with potential data loss from "WideString" to "AnsiString"
# As we normally use AnsiString, and we deal with XML units
# (using WideString / UnicodeString), this is normal situation for us.
#-vm4104 # not available in FPC 2.6.4

# syntax options --------------------------------------------------------

# Default syntax mode.
#
# We use objfpc mode for everything. Some reasons why it's better
# than delphi mode:
# - There are some things strange in delphi mode, for compat with delphi/tp,
#   that sometimes bite me (like the fact that in FPC >= 2.0.3
#   Single(Integer) makes a variable typecast, not a value typecast).
# - Moreover, ObjFpc has many sensible improvements:
#   the whole way of assigning procedural variables
#   is much better ("@" is required, and assignment is always checked
#   for parameter correctness (in delphi mode @ may be omitted; when it's
#   not omitted, you can cheat and pass procedure with not matching params))
# - Check that method parameter names must differ from class
#   fields/methods/properties --- this is great.
-Mobjfpc

# use ansistrings
-Sh
# macros on
-Sm
# c-like operators +=, -= etc.
-Sc
# allow inline (but always surround it in {$ifdef SUPPORTS_INLINE})
-Si

# units/includes paths --------------------------------------------------

# It seems that FPC does not define symbol UNIX before reading config file,
# even though it defines LINUX (or FREEBSD; I assume that this is also

  #   false errors. IOW, unless you know what you're doing (and can
  #   recognize false error from a real one in the engine code), don't use -gc.

  # 2.Also, -gc for whole code still makes code much slower.
