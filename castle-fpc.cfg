# FPC configuration file for Castle Game Engine.
# Pretty much normal configuration for people that like modern ObjectPascal
# and ObjFpc mode.
#
# Accepts two switches: DEBUG and RELEASE. If you don't define any of them
# debug and optimizing code will be done according to compiler defaults.
# Never define both of them.
#
# Accepts a switch CASTLE_ENGINE_PATHS_ALREADY_DEFINED:
# in this case we will assume that proper -Fu and -Fi, to provide
# paths for FPC to our units, have already been defined.
# This allows to call FPC from any directory (otherwise you have to call
# FPC from this directory, containing castle-fpc.cfg, to make relative paths
# here work).
#
# For alternative, more flexible compilation method use
# tools/build-tool/castle-engine.lpr
# [https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/wiki/Build-Tool] .
#

# output options -------------------------------------------------------------

# Show FPC logo (shows fpc version)
-l

# Show warnings + notes.
# Do not show hints (there are too many useless hints produced by FPC).
-vwn

# Input/output checks always, even in release version.
# Some code may depend on the fact that IO errors in standard Pascal
# functions are checked automatically (and raise exceptions
# if SysUtils is compiled in). Although 99% of code should use TStream
# instead of old Pascal IO, and then this switch doesn't matter.

# syntax options --------------------------------------------------------

# Default syntax mode.
#
# When compiled with FPC, we use ObjFpc mode by default
# (if CASTLE_ENGINE_TEST_DELPHI_MODE not defined, and it's really only for internal
# testing).
#
# Some reasons why we prefer -Mobjfpc (not -Mdelphi mode):
#
# - There are some things strange in delphi mode, for compatibility with delphi/tp,
#   that sometimes bite me (like the fact that in FPC >= 2.0.3
#   Single(Integer) makes a variable typecast, not a value typecast).
#   TODO: check is the above still true?
#
# - ObjFpc has some nice improvements:
#
#   - Assigning procedural variables is better:
#     "@" is required to get an address of a procedure,
#     and assignment is always checked for parameter correctness.
#     In Delphi mode @ may be omitted, and when it's
#     not omitted, you can cheat and pass procedure with not matching params.
#     Using {$TYPEDADDRESS ON} in Delphi (10.2) helps with this
#     (but not in FPC Delphi mode).
#
#   - Overloading without the "overload" keyword is often more sane:
#     It's not cross-class and cross-unit. This allows to hide ancestor
#     methods, while still defining multiple versions of them.
#     It avoids a nasty trap of Delphi "overload" described
#     at TNoParameterlessContructor documentation.
#
#   - Check that method parameter names must differ from class
#     fields/methods/properties names --- this is nice, saves you from some
#     hard to spot bugs otherwise when renaming.
#
# - ObjFpc is preferred by Lazarus, suggested for new source code by Lazarus.
