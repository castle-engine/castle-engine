Two `*_Connectors.x3d` testcases here come from X_ITE demos on
https://github.com/create3000/Library/blob/main/Tests/Components/Shape/Connectors.x3d .

Reported in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-model-viewer/issues/112 .
The usage of prototypes here used to call an issue with CGE (fixed now).
