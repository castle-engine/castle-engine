/*
  Tasks definitions for compiling and running
  Castle Game Engine projects in VS Code.

  You can use this file for .vscode/tasks.json file in a workspace,
  or as "User level tasks" (indepedent of workspace).

  This tasks file allows to compile /run / compile+run the CGE project
  associated with the currently open file.

  Since it uses the currently open file,
  it will work even with repositories that contain multiple CGE projects,
  like https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/
  (which contains many examples and tools).
  If your VS Code workspace is just a single CGE project,
  then you can remove the line

    "cwd": "${fileDirname}"

  This way the tasks will just use CGE project in VS code workspace,
  regardless of the currently open file.

  See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  for the documentation about the tasks.json format.

  This file is distributed as public domain.
