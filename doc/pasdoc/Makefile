# Main targets to gen final docs ----------------------------------------

# Avoid using WSL bash on GH-hosted runner windows-latest,
# by explicitly using GIT (MSys) bash.
# Note: Setting SHELL doesn't help.
#
# This is a hack, after a long fight with it -- no idea why this specific
# Makefile (but not others) seems to try to execute WSL bash in this sitiuation.
# Various tests on GH hosted runner with this script and mingw32-make,
# /c/mingw64/bin/make resulted in various weird errors
# (like make segfaulting, or "cp" not finding a dir that "ls" shows exists...).
# This seems like the most local workaround that reliably avoids the problem.
