- In general, we follow the standard Lazarus and Delphi coding conventions,
  used throughout most modern Object Pascal code.

  These are documented nicely on:
  - http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/10280 - Object Pascal Style Guide
  - http://kodu.ut.ee/~jellen/delphi/cs.html - Delphi Language Coding Standards Document
    (Not available anymore? Access through Web Archive:
    https://web.archive.org/web/20170607183644/http://kodu.ut.ee/~jellen/delphi/cs.html
    )

  In particular:
  - Indent by 2 spaces.
  - Use CamelCase for everything,
    - including constants, so MyConstant instead of MY_CONSTANT,
    - and local variables, even "I" instead of "i".
  - Put "begin" on a separate line.
    I.e. do not mimic C "K & R" style
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R) in Pascal:
    ~~~~
    // DON'T WRITE THIS:
    for I := 1 to 10 do begin
      Writeln(I);
    end;
    ~~~~
    Instead, the "begin" should usually be indented the same as "end".
    ~~~~
    // THIS IS OK:
    for I := 1 to 10 do
    begin
      Writeln(I);
    end;
    ~~~~
    To avoid verbosity, it's OK to omit begin/end for statements:
    ~~~~
    // THIS IS EVEN BETTER:
    for I := 1 to 10 do
      Writeln(I);
    ~~~~
  - The "else" keyword is written on a new line, unless it's right after "end". So:
    ~~~~
    // THIS IS OK:
    if Foo then
      Bar
    else
      Xyz;

    // THIS IS ALSO OK:
    if Foo then
    begin
      Bar
    end else
    begin
      Xyz;
    end;

    // THIS IS ALSO OK:
    if Foo then
    begin
      Bar
    end else
      Xyz;

    // THIS IS ACCEPTABLE, BUT BETTER AVOID IT:
    if Foo then
      Bar
    else
    begin
      Xyz;
    end;

    // THIS IS NOT OK:
    if Foo then
    begin
      Bar
    end
    else
    begin
      Xyz;
    end;

    // THIS IS NOT OK, BUT IS USED IN A LOT OF CODE:
    // (Michalis was using this for a long time,
    // until it was pointed to him that it's not optimal,
    // and most e.g. Lazarus code doesn't use it):
    // Try not to use this in new code, but don't be surprised if it still occurs somewhere.
    // We gradually get rid of it.
    if Foo then
      Bar else
      Xyz;
    ~~~
  - Never use tabs (convert to spaces).
  - Never leave trailing whitespace at the end of lines (in the long run,
    it causes unnecessary diffs when someone removes it).
  - Never use "with".
    Using "with" makes the code very difficult to read,
    as some of the symbols inside the "with A do begin .... end" clause
    are bound to A, and some are not, but it's completely invisible
    to the human reader which symbols are which.
    And it's impossible to determine it, without intimately knowing the complete
    API of class/record A.

    E.g. what does this code do?

    ```
    with A do
    begin
      SourceX := X;
      SourceY := Y;
    end;
    ```

    Does it modify A contents, or does it modify outside variables,
    merely reading the A contents? You really don't know,
    until I show you the documentation of the class of A, and all it's ancestors.

    Compare with a clear:

    ```
    SourceX := A.X;
    SourceY := A.Y;
    ```

    or

    ```
    A.SourceX := X;
    A.SourceY := Y;
    ```

    The "with" also makes the code very fragile to any changes of A API.
    Every time you add a new field/property/method to A,
    then the code inside "with A do begin .... end" may change it's meaning.
    It may compile, but suddenly will do something completely different.

    Likewise, every time you remove a field/property/method from A,
    the code inside "with A do begin .... end" may compile, if you happen
    to have a variable outside of this block with a name matching the name
    inside A.
  - The uses clause of our units and examples should follow the order
    - standard units (RTL, LCL, VCL...)
    - then our own (CastleXxx) units
    - then eventual game-specific units (GameXxx)
    Each part should start from a newline.
    ```
    // THIS IS OK:
    uses SysUtils, Classes,
      CastleUtils, CastleSceneManager,
      GameStatePlay;
    ```

- File extensions:

  *.pas files are units,
  *.inc are files to be included in other Pascal source files using $I
        (short for $Include).
  *.dpr are main program files.
        This changes in CGE >= 6.3.
        In CGE < 6.3, program files had .lpr extension, since we used only Lazarus.
        In CGE >= 6.3, we use both Lazarus and Delphi.
        While Lazarus accepts either .dpr or .lpr extension for the program file,
        Delphi tolerates only .dpr extension. So we have to (unfortunately)
        adjust to Delphi, and just use .dpr.

  Do not use *.pp (not familiar to people from Delphi).

- The engine is, in general, not thread-safe.
  You cannot call our functions from different threads.

  Reasons:
  - We use some global caches, and securing access to them from multiple
    threads would cost us speed (and make code more complex).
  - OpenGL must be operated from a single thread anyway.

  There are some things that in practice can be safely used from multiple
  threads now (some image and file loading, some OpenAL operations),
  but please don't depend on it. Unless something is clearly documented
  as "thread-safe", DO NOT assume it.

- All the engine functions are "reentrant", which means that they are safe
  to be called recursively, even through your own callbacks.
  E.g. the TFileProc callback passed to EnumFiles can call EnumFiles inside
  it's own implementation.

- Some naming conventions:

  - If some procedure modifies it's 1st parameter then I usually
    end it's name with "Var" ("to variable").

    Often you will be able to see the same operation coming in two
    flavours:

    ~~~~
    function DoSomething(const X: <type>, ...):<type>;
    procedure DoSomethingVar(var X: <type>,...);
    ~~~~

    The 1st (functional-like) version is more flexible,
    but the 2nd version may be faster (especially if <type> is large,
    or requires time-consuming initialization).

    See e.g. CastleVectors and CastleImages units.

    This rule doesn't apply when <type> is some class instance.
    It's normal that a procedure may modify the given class instance
    contents, no need to signify this with a "Var" suffix.

  - If somewhere I use parameters like V: ^<type> and Stride: Integer
    then it means that these parameters define a table of <type> values.
    Address of 1st item is V, address of i-th is (V + i * Stride).
    This is a convention used by OpenGL's vertex array routines.

    Stride may be negative. Stride may also be 0, then it means
    that Stride = SizeOf(<type>).

- Compilation symbols used:

  Standard FPC and Delphi ones: MSWINDOWS, UNIX, LINUX,
  CPUI386, CPUX86_64, FPC to differentiate between compiler versions,
  and some more.

  See castleconf.inc.

  We also use DEBUG symbol.
  Also castle-fpc.cfg adds some checks when -dDEBUG.
  The build tool when compiled in debug mode (--mode=debug) also defines
  DEBUG, and adds some checks.
  You can use DEBUG in your own code to add additional things.
  There's also the RELEASE symbol, but usually we don't check for
  it's existence -- if DEBUG then we're in debug mode,
  else we're in release mode.
  So there's no need to check for RELEASE symbol.

- Exceptions' messages:

  - Do not start them with 'Error: ' or 'Error - ' or anything else
    that just says "we have an error".
    This would be redundant, it would be necessary for *almost all* exception messages,
    since almost all signal some error.
    So don't say it -- the fact that you're raising an Exception
    already signals that this is some kind of error.

  - Don't end the Message with '!' character.
    All error messages signal that something bad happened,
    so '!' would be necessary for *almost all* exception messages if you would
    follow this.
    Instead, keep the cold blood, and keep the error message "clean and calm".

  - Usually, Message should be a single sentence,
    and not end with the '.' character.
    We do not follow this rule 100%, it's OK to break it with good reasons.

  - Message should not contain any line-breaks. Reason: this doesn't
    look good when displayed in some situations. Especially when
    one Message is embedded as part of the Message of other exception.

    We do not follow this rule 100%, it's OK to break it with good reasons.
    I know that some information really looks much cleaner when split into
    multiple lines (e.g. TMatrix4.ToString output is multi-line already).

  - Message should not contain any general program information like
    ApplicationName, ExeName etc. (The exception to this rule is when
    such information is really related to the error that happened,
    may help to explain this error etc.)
    In normal situation, the code that finally catched and outputs
    this exception should show such information.

- Callbacks: "of object" or not?

  ObjectPascal is a hybrid OOP language and it has
  global function pointers and method pointers.
  They are incompatible, since the method pointer is actually two pointers
  (the class instance, and the code address).
  When designing a function that takes a callback, you're faced with a problem:
  define "a pointer to a method" or "a pointer to a global function/procedure"?

  In the past, I often chose to use "a pointer to a global function/procedure".
  With a generic "Data: Pointer" parameter, to allow passing user data.
  This is easier to use when you don't have a class instance
  (and you don't want to create a dummy class just for this),
  and it's always allows to add overridden version with "of object" callback
  (passing object instance as the Data);

  Nowadays, I usually define "of object" callbacks,
  assuming that all non-trivial code is usually in some class,
  and the "of object" is more natural to be used in OOP.
