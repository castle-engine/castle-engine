Good command-line options conventions:

(These guided the design of CastleParameters unit.
The OptionDescription routine honors it too.)

Options specifications (printed in response to the --help parameter)
should look like this :

(only long form)
'  --long-option        This option description'
'  --long-option ARGUMENT-NAME'
'                       This option description'
'  --very-long-option-name ARGUMENT'
'                       This option has very very long description'
'                       that must be continued on the next line'

(both forms, short and long, available)
'  -s / --long-option   This option description'
'  -s / --long-option  ARGUMENT-NAME'
'                       This option description'

More formally:

- if option has both short and long forms they are specified using
  '-s / --long-option' (with <space>/<space>),

- all help lines can have at most 75 chars,

- 2 spaces are required before option name,

- option descriptions should always start at the 25th column,
  if you can (and want) you can start option description at the same
  line as option name + arguments specification (but always at 25th column,
  so you can't do this if option name + arguments is too long),
  if not - you have to go to the next line. Each subsequent description line
  must be prefixed with 24 spaces (always spaces, never tabs !).
