# We expect that you commit text files with Unix line endings to the repository.
# If you work on Windows, you can configure GIT to either automatically convert
# between Windows/Unix on download/upload (so you will see Windows line endings,
# but you will still commit Unix line endings),
# or you can let GIT to preserve line endings from the repository
# (in which case you will see, and commit, Unix line endings;
# make sure that your text editor handles Unix line endings,
# and that you create new lines with Unix line endings).
