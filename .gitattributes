#   Very helpful to learn evolution of line endings handling in GIT --
#   recommendations changed over time.
# We expect that you commit text files with Unix line endings to the repository.
# If you work on Windows, you can configure GIT to either automatically convert
# between Windows/Unix on download/upload (so you will see Windows line endings,
# but you will still commit Unix line endings),
# or you can let GIT to preserve line endings from the repository
# (in which case you will see, and commit, Unix line endings;
# make sure that your text editor handles Unix line endings,
# and that you create new lines with Unix line endings).

# Note: svg could *probably* be treated as text (it's XML, line endings
# could be native), but it's safer to treat it as binary.
# We edit it in mostly graphic editors like Inkscape anyway,
# so no need to worry about line endings and text editors.

# Treat these as binary, they may contain gzip data - see tests/data/gzipped_x3d/sphere_normal_extension_but_gzipped.wrl

# Do not convert line endings inside these files,
# as they have to be equal to line endings inside test ZIP.

# Even on Windows, shell scripts line endings must be Unix, to work with Cygwin's bash.
