interface

  CastleVectors, CastleScene, CastleTransform;

type
  { Simple enemy intelligence.
    It controls the parent Scene (TCastleScene): moves it, runs animations of it etc.

    This is a TCastleBehavior descendant,
    and is inserted to parent like EnemyScene.AddBehavior(...).
    You can get the TEnemy instance of a TCastleScene,
    by taking "Scene.FindBehavior(TEnemy)".

    Other ways of making an association TCastleScene <-> TEnemy logic are possible:

    - TEnemy could be an independent class (not connected to any CGE class),
      and simply have a reference to CGE TCastleScene instance.

      This makes it easy to map TEnemy->TCastleScene.
      To map TCastleScene->TEnemy you could e.g. use TCastleScene.Tag,
      or a dedicated map structure like TDictionary from Generics.Collections.

    - You could also make TEnemy a descendant of TCastleScene.

    Note that TCastleBehavior or TCastleTransform descendants could be
    registered in the CGE editor to visually add and edit them from editor.
    See https://castle-engine.io/custom_components .
    In this unit we call RegisterSerializableComponent,
    so you only need to add editor_units="GameEnemy" to CastleEngineManifest.xml
    to see it in action.
