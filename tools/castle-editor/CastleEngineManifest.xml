<!--
Thanks to this manifest file, CGE editor is itself a "regular"
CGE project that:

- can be compiled using CGE build tool

    Because of build_using_lazbuild="true", in this case CGE build tool
    when called as "castle-engine compile"
    just executes "lazbuild castle_editor.lpi" and not much more.

- can be opened inside CGE editor.

See https://castle-engine.io/project_manifest for documentation of this file.
