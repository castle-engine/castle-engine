Slightly retouched by Michalis Kamburelis:

- To make sizes be power-of-2.

  Although Castle Game Engine can use any texture size,
  but it is best to use power-of-2 size for textures for 3D stuff,
  to enable mipmapping and fast loading at the same time.
  Otherwise, textures have to be resized at loading to enable mipmapping.
  And you want mipmapping in 3D (gives nice look when scaled in the distance).

- To use PNG format for all.
