    Larger games may use multiple states,
    e.g. TStateMainMenu ("main menu state"),
    TStatePlay ("playing the game state"),
    TStateCredits ("showing the credits state") etc. }

  { You should not need to do *anything* more in the unit "initialization" section.
    Most of your game initialization should happen inside ApplicationInitialize.
    In particular, it is not allowed to read files before ApplicationInitialize
    (because in case of non-desktop platforms,
    some necessary resources may not be prepared yet). }
