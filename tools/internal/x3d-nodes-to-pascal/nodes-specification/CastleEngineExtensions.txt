# Specification of Castle Game Engine X3D extensions.
# See https://castle-engine.io/x3d_extensions.php .
# This file is in the format understood by
# our ../x3d-nodes-to-pascal/x3d-nodes-to-pascal.lpr
# and by White Dune scripts.
#
# Note that we only list here *new* X3D nodes.
# Extensions (new fields) to existing nodes must be listed in other txt files
# (otherwse x3d-nodes-to-pascal would not be able to handle them).
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "KambiAppearance" is just a synonym for "Appearance" now.
#
# Now we just add all new fields to the standard "Appearance" node.
# Reasons: we describe in shadow_maps_x3d paper
# our propositions for Appearance (without introducing KambiAppearance,
# as (in the future) these should not be specific to our engine),
# also InstantReality already has Appearance.blendMode.
#
# You can however use KambiAppearance in your models, this allows you
# to declare KambiAppearance by EXTERNPROTO and fallback on standard
# Appearance.

    Additional libraries of shader code to link with this effect.

    Each "shader library" defines a shader code, just like an additional EffectNode. This code can define new GLSL functions to use in your effect code, e.g. @code(position_world_to_eye_space). This code can also use PLUGs just like other effects, so it can influence the rendering and other computations. The engine has (right now hardcoded) logic to provide necessary uniform values for every shader library, so you don't need to do anything additional to make the added code functional.

    Right now, only one shader library is allowed: 'castle-shader:/EyeWorldSpace.glsl'. This is linked with both vertex and fragment stages, and exposes new GLSL functions you can use:

    @preformatted(
      vec4 position_world_to_eye_space(vec4 position_world);
      vec4 position_eye_to_world_space(vec4 position_eye);

    Shapes whose geometries are affected by the skinned animation, that is: their vertexes move to follow the joints that are associated with them.

    Only shapes with geometries that have @code(SkinWeights0) and @code(SkinJoints0) fields are allowed here. This means these geometry nodes: @link(TAbstractComposedGeometryNode) (with its numerous descendants, all "meshes" that are composed of triangles, quads, faces...), @link(TIndexedLineSetNode), @link(TLineSetNode) and @link(TPointSetNode).

    The geometries within these shapes are affected by this skinned animation.
    Their @code(SkinJoints0) indexes refer to our @link(Joints).

    Note that you can place here only shape nodes, not groups or hierarchies of them (e.g. @link(TGroupNode) or @link(TTransformNode)). This is a deliberate constraint to make working of this node obvious.

    This also matches the glTF usage, where the meshes affected by one skin are always within one and the same transformation. glTF specification says @italic("Only the joint transforms are applied to the skinned mesh; the transform of the skinned mesh node MUST be ignored.") which in practice forces treating all skinned shapes as if they were direct children alongside the skeleton root.

    We make it more explicit in our design: the @link(Shapes) are explicitly direct children of the @link(TSkinNode). So the shapes are affected by the transformations of the @link(TSkinNode). Any further transformation of shapes has to happen through the skinned animation (joints affecting shapes vertexes according to weights), not through the direct transformations of the shapes themselves.

    Note that you can also place @link(TShapeNode) instances within the @link(Skeleton) hierarchy. Such shapes are not affected by the skinned animation, they are just rigid 3D shapes attached to the joints (like a sword may be attached to the avatar's hand).
