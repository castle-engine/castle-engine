{ Do not auto-create below forms that use TCastleControl, and would initialize OpenGL
  right when the CGE editor opens.

  Reason: In case someone has broken OpenGL library installation
  we don't want to have CGE editor just crash at start, it's better if it will crash
  later -- allowing us to recognize this case (e.g. because it crashes when you open any
  design or "System Information").

  If there's a single variable to hold single form instance, you can initialize it on-demand, like

    if SystemInformationForm = nil then
      SystemInformationForm := TSystemInformationForm.Create(Application);
    SystemInformationForm.Show;
}

begin
  RequireDerivedFormResource := True;
  Application.Scaled := True;
  Application.Initialize;
  Application.CreateForm(TIcons, Icons);
  Application.CreateForm(TChooseProjectForm, ChooseProjectForm);
  Application.CreateForm(TNewProjectForm, NewProjectForm);
  Application.CreateForm(TAboutForm, AboutForm);
  Application.CreateForm(TPreferencesForm, PreferencesForm);
  Application.CreateForm(TImportAtlasForm, ImportAtlasForm);
  Application.CreateForm(TImportStarlingForm, ImportStarlingForm);
  Application.CreateForm(TNewUnitForm, NewUnitForm);
  Application.CreateForm(TRestartCustomEditorForm, RestartCustomEditorForm);
  Application.Run;
end.
