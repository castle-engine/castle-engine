## google_play_services

This service includes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Services[Google Play Services] library into your Android projects. It doesn't provide anything immediately useful, but it's required by some other services, like `google_play_games`, `google_analytics`, `admob`.

The necessary files from Google will be automatically downloaded, along with all their dependencies, using the _Gradle_ build system, at the first build. You only have to declare using the service by

[,xml]
----
<service name="google_play_services" />
----

Note that this only includes the "base" Google Play Services subset.  Particular services (like `google_play_games`) may want to add more Google Play Services subsets in their `build.gradle` snippets.

- See https://developers.google.com/android/guides/setup#split for the service names.
- See ../google_play_games/app/build.gradle for an example.
