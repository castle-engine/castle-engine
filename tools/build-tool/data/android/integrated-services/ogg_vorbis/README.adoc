## Tremolo (reading OggVorbis sound files) for Android

Enable the _OggVorbis_ sound format on Android.

_There is no need to include this service explicitly_, it is automatically added if your game depends on "OggVorbis". Which in turn is automatically detected when the build tool notices an `.ogg` file inside your data, although it can also be explicitly requested by declaring `<dependency name="OggVorbis" />` in link:pass:[CastleEngineManifest.xml examples][CastleEngineManifest.xml].

In effect, loading OggVorbis sound files in your Android games _just works_.

We use very fast open-source OggVorbis implementation called _Tremolo_, see https://github.com/castle-engine/android-tremolo[].

Note that on Android, the sound engine (with OpenAL underneath) has to be paused / resumed when user switches between applications. If you play some music, and you want resuming to start it again -- you need to register you callback on `SoundEngine.OnOpenClose` to handle this situation. If you play music using `TMusicPlayer`, this is taken care of automatically.
