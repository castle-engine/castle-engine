## open_associated_urls

This Android service is automatically used if your project manifest declares that the application should be associated with some file types. There should never be a need to declare using this service explicitly.

The file associations are configured using the `<associate_document_types>` XML elements in `CastleEngineManifest.xml`. See https://castle-engine.io/project_manifest#_associated_file_types for details.

See example usage in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-model-viewer-mobile/blob/master/CastleEngineManifest.xml .
