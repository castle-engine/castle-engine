## sound

Enable the sound service on Android.

_There is no need to include this service explicitly_, it is automatically added if:

* You have any sound file (`\*.wav`, `*.ogg`) in your `data` directory.

* Or you have `<dependency name="Sound" />` in https://castle-engine.io/project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml].

### OpenAL source code

This service includes https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/[OpenAL Soft] source code in C++. It will be compiled by Gradle automatically when building Android package.
