## read_extenal_storage

This service asks user for permissions to read Android _"external storage"_.

_"External storage"_ includes normal files, which can be accessed in _Castle Game Engine_ and Pascal through the standard file API (like `TFileStream` from `Classes` unit or `Download` from `CastleDownload` unit). In case of _Castle Game Engine_, files can be accessed using the URLs with `file` protocol (like `file:///storage/emulated/0/my_file.txt`) or an explicit Unix file path (like `/storage/emulated/0/my_file.txt`).

These are e.g. files in your internal memory and SD cards.

Note: This service is not necessary to read files from https://castle-engine.io/data[data directory] on Android. The application data, pakaged in APK, is installed to a special application-specific directory on Android, to which your app always has access.

Note: This service is not necessary if you also use `write_external_storage`. If an application has write access, it implicitly also has read access (as documented on https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE ).
