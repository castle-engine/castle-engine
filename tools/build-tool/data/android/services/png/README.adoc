## libpng (efficient reading of PNG files) for Android

This service adds the `libpng` library to the Android project, which allows CGE to read/write PNG files more efficiently.

You usually do not need to do anything to use this, as the service will be automatically included in projects where .png files are found in `data`.

Though you can also request this service explicitly in link:https://castle-engine.io/project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml]. You can request it only for Android:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<project name="..." game_units="...">
  <android>
    <services>
      <service name="png" />
    </services>
  </android>
</project>
----

Or you can request the equivalent on all platforms using `dependencies`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<project name="..." game_units="...">
  <dependencies>
    <dependency name="Png" />
  </dependencies>
</project>
----
