## FreeType (reading font files) for Android

Enable loading the `.ttf`, `.otf` font files on Android (and other font formats handled by the https://www.freetype.org/ library).

You usually do not need to do anything to use this, as the service will be automatically included in projects where `.ttf`, `.otf` files are found in `data`.
