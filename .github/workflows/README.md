# Quick version of GitHub Actions that build CGE

These actions only build Windows and Linux releases of CGE, ASAP, without most of the tests.

Use only when you're

- relatively sure all tests pass (in particular, Delphi compilation)

- you only want ASAP builds of CGE for Windows/x86_64 and Linux/x86_64

- you really need release ASAP.
