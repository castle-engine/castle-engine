# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GitHub Action workflow to
#
# - test CGE compilation and automatic tests
# - pack CGE into zip
#
# on platforms for which we use https://github.com/marketplace/actions/arm-runner
# which in practice means: for Raspberry Pi 64-bit and 32-bit.
#
# The intention is to do exactly the same thing as test-and-pack-runner-native.yml,
# but it has to be implemented differently, since the ARM machines are not
# "normal runners" for GitHub Actions. Instead:
# - GitHub Actions runs ubuntu-latest,
# - and inside we use https://github.com/marketplace/actions/arm-runner
# - ... which takes things to do as "commands".
#
# See https://github.com/michaliskambi/test-arm-runner-for-cge/ for repo
# with tests of the arm-runner + CGE.
