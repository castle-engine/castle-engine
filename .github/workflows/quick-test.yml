# GitHub Action workflow to quickly test that some CGE tools/examples compile.
#
# This is a small subset of tests done by test-and-pack.yml ,
# just to make a quick error in case you break the compilation of a critical CGE part.
# The full test-and-pack.yml tests much more, but takes about 2h now.
