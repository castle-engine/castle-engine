      #   (there are small differences in binaries, though both use the same FPC version
      #   but e.g. FPC puts absolute paths in some binaries, so they differ).
      #   We choose to use macos_x64 as the primary runner for the release,
      #   since this is our own machine (self hosted), we have more control over it.
      #
      # - windows-latest, because the test-and-pack-docker.yml is also doing
      #   equivalent build (castle-engine-7.0-alpha.snapshot-win64-x86_64.zip).
      #   Moreover that Docker job is also doing version bundled
      #   with FPC (castle-engine-7.0-alpha.snapshot-win64-x86_64-bundle.zip)
      #   and win32 (castle-engine-7.0-alpha.snapshot-win32-i386.zip).
      #   OTOH, windows-latest is doing castle-engine-setup-7.0-alpha.snapshot.exe,
      #   as it has to be done on Windows (with InnoSetup).
      #
      #   The differences between doing a job in Docker and windows-latest are
      #   ignorable:
      #   - From Docker, we get Unix line endings even for Windows build
      #     since its a checkout on Linux.
      #     (disadvantage but ignorable, nothing seems to complain?),
      #   - PasDoc version from Docker is slightly different (advantage,
      #     we control PasDoc version in Docker better, consistent with others).
      #   - Docker build is a bit safer, as packing is a separate job,
      #     not depending that cge_clean_all in pack_release.sh
      #     cleans everything.
      #
      # - is_gh_ubuntu, because the test-and-pack-docker.yml is also doing
      #   equivalent build (castle-engine-7.0-alpha.snapshot-linux-x86_64.zip).
      #   The Docker job is a bit better, see above about windows-latest:
      #   PasDoc version in Docker is more consistent,
      #   and the build does not rely on cge_clean_all.
