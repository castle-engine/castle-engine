# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GitHub Action workflow to
#
# - test CGE compilation and automatic tests (using various FPC versions available in Docker)
# - pack CGE into zip (using only stable FPC, since our pack_release checks it)
#
# Uses CGE Docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/kambi/castle-engine-cloud-builds-tools/
# inside GH hosted runner.
#
# See https://docs.github.com/en/actions for docs.
